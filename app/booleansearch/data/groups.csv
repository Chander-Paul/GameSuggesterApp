"Monkey Island is a series of comedy adventure games set in fictional 18th century-like Caribbean Islands, telling the story of the young wannabe-pirate Guybrush Threepwood. The series was originally envisioned as a trilogy by the main designer Ron Gilbert, but he only completed the first two games; the third and the fourth were made without his participation. The latter signified the conclusion of the original series, being the last one developed by LucasArts.

Like most LucasArts adventures, Monkey Island games are ""death-free"" (the player character cannot die), have no ""dead ends"" (the player cannot get irrevocably stuck), and are based on inventory puzzles and branching dialogue. The series' first installment, The Secret of Monkey Island (1990), was also the first adventure game made by LucasArts that answered all of the above requirements, defining the company's adventure game design philosophy.

In 2009, Telltale licensed the property for a five-part episodic adventure game, which eventually became Tales of Monkey Island.

"A series of graphical fantasy adventure games featuring the escapades of King Graham and his royal family, rulers of the fairy-tale land of Daventry. It was originally designed by Roberta Williams and developed by Sierra On-Line, Inc.
King's Quest is Sierra's longest-running and largest adventure game series. The first game (1984) is widely regarded as the progenitor of third-person perspective adventures; it combined text input with physical character navigation in a graphically represented world. Like other adventure game series made by the same company, King's Quest switched to icon-based, point-and-click interface in the fifth installment.

Despite its position as the company's flagship adventure series, King's Quest ended the principal phase of its existence with an action/adventure hybrid (1998). Afterwards, the series shared the fate of most adventure game franchises - it was effectively terminated, until interest in it was somewhat renewed, following the appearance of several fan-made remakes of its first installments. An episodic adventure game entitled The Silver Lining (2010) attempted to restore the series, continuing its overarching plot.

"Space Quest is a series of comedy adventure games developed by Sierra. The games are set in a sci-fi environment and feature the reluctant hero Roger Wilco, a janitor who initially works on one of the space stations and repeatedly saves the galaxy (often by accident), following his motto ""for truth, justice, and really clean floors"". 

The series was conceived by Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy, ""two guys from Andromeda"", according to their self-designation in Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon. Humorous content includes, among others, many parodies and references to famous movie franchises, most notably Star Wars.

Gameplay-wise, the games in the series follow traditional templates Sierra was using for its other adventure games. Early games were particularly notable for placing the main character's life in constant danger, rewarding the player with amusing death scenes and messages in case of failure. Later Space Quest installments concentrated more on puzzle-solving. 

The series ended with Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier (1995). A few attempts to continue the series were made, including a sequel announced by Sierra in 1996, named Space Quest VII: Return to Roman Numerals. In 2002, a game entitled simply Space Quest begun development by Escape Factory for a release on the Xbox console. None of these sequels were ever completed. The unofficial sequel Space Quest VII was 
in development between 2001 and 2009. It was cancelled after intervention by the copyright holder Vivendi.

"A series of comedy games (primarily in adventure genre), originally created by Al Lowe, focusing mostly on the efforts of a middle-aged gentleman named Larry Laffer (and later, his nephew) to have a date with a girl, and maybe also to find the love of his life.

The series started its existence with Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards (1987), though its early precursor, a text adventure named Softporn (1981), is often indicated as the progenitor. Chronologically falling in line with various Quest game series developed by Sierra (such as King's Quest and Space Quest), Larry games followed a similar gameplay evolution: starting with text input (and a text parser that ""understood"" swear words and verbs denoting sexual activities), the series later switched to mouse-driven, point-and-click gameplay with command icons - including the famous ""zipper"" icon, unique to the series, which corresponded to the aforementioned text input peculiarities.

The last Larry game designed by Al Lowe was Love for Sail (1996). The series' classical epoch has come to its end in this installment; however, an attempt to revive the series, steering it into action/arcade, mini-games-based gameplay, was made in 2004 with the release of Magna Cum Laude.

Not included: the 1992 Laffer Utilities, a humorous suite of ""non-productivity"" applications.

Leisure Suit Larry 4

The Larry series was originally planned as a trilogy. If you saw the ending of the third game, you know that it’s well-rounded and final. When designer Al Lowe had finished Larry 3 in 1989, he was somewhat fed up with his creation, and announced that there’d “never be a Larry 4!”

At least not a “normal” adventure game. In 1989, Sierra had ambitious plans to build up an online gaming community. Nobody knew if this would work, but it was clear that it needed a “killer application”; an online adventure game with a score of players working together simultaneously. That’s what Larry 4 was supposed to be. However, the project turned out to be much more complicated than anyone had expected. As Al Lowe describes on his website:

&gt; After a month or so, we knew we were in trouble. I decided to write a checkers game as a simple test case to see if we could actually move objects and communicate. It worked. But we were still a long way from making characters walk and communicate and interact.
&gt; 
&gt; So I wrote a backgammon game. Then chess. Still we had no system to support all the features needed for an adventure game. But we were having so much fun playing against each other, we decided to push what we had into a real product. It became The Sierra Network. TSN was quite successful in its day, especially considering the small numbers of players who also had modems.
&gt; 
&gt; Eventually, when TSN was losing 10 million dollars per year, Ken [Williams] sold half of it to AT&amp;T for 50 million dollars. I laughingly said Sierra was the only company to make money in on-line gaming: by selling out! Later AT&amp;T would pay another 50 mil for the other half. They then sat on it for about a year before giving up and selling the whole thing to America On-Line for 10 million. AOL announced big plans, but never carried through and the whole thing withered up and died without ever seeing the light of day.

When Al Lowe finally decided that the Larry series needed to be continued, and started to work on the next off-line episode, he was reluctant to call it Larry 4. Hadn’t he exclaimed that there wouldn’t be a game with that name? He kept his promise. The next adventure was a ""fifth"" game.

Even though the 4th episode does not exist, it has an official name nevertheless: Leisure Suit Larry 4: The Missing Floppies’.

"The Police Quest series are traditional adventure games developed by Sierra, which follow the adventures of Sonny Bonds, a police officer in the fictional city of Lytton, California. The first three games were designed under the supervision of former Highway Patrol officer Jim Walls.

The last game in the series is a departure from the first three, and follows a murder investigation in real-life Los Angeles, led by detective John Carey. Jim Walls was replaced by former LAPD Chief Daryl F. Gates. The adventure games were discontinued after the fourth game, but Sierra continued to publish ""police simulators"" under the brand name SWAT.",8,Police Quest series
"In the MechWarrior games the player is a MechWarrior, a pilot of a Mech (a humanoid battle machine with the weight up to 100 tons). The player is responsible for equipping his Mech with weapons, armor and equipment before entering the battlefield. On the battlefield, the player fights tanks, aeroplanes and other Mechs. Most of the usable weapons produce heat, which will be reduced by time. If a Mech has too much heat, the Mech will be shut down (or explodes, if the heat reaches a too high value).

In the later games of this game group, the player has to ""organise"" (steal, capture or buy) the materials he wishes to use in combat. Allies and battlefield repairs are available in the later games, too. 

Origins

This series of games is based on the pen &amp; paper game MechWarrior, a part of FASA's Battletech universe. Instead of piloting Mechs like the basic BattleTech board game, players created specific characters like spies, pilots, commandos, etc. and developed them on a collection of adventures in classic D&amp;D fashion.

"A series of adventure games set in a post-apocalyptic world with elements of a detective film noir setting, starring the private investigator Tex Murphy. The games were developed by Access Software and designed by Chris Jones, who also played the titular character in all the installments of the series that featured live actors.

The setting in all the games is the city of San Francisco in the fourth decade of the 21st century. Following the Third World War, much of the city has been damaged or destroyed; many of the surviving humans, exposed to radiation, have turned into mutants. During the series' timeline, non-mutated humans (called Norms) co-exist with mutants. The titular protagonist is a ""hard-boiled"" P.I. with relationship and drinking problems; lonely, observant, and witty, Tex Murphy recreates the classic film noir detective type in the unusual post-apocalyptic scenario.

The gameplay in all Tex Murphy games is based on conversations, interrogations, searching for clues, as well as inventory-based and other types of puzzles. Later installments emphasized the puzzle-solving aspect, introducing increasingly complex puzzles; they also featured in-game hint systems and the possibility to have the puzzles solved automatically at the expense of points.

From a technological point of view, Tex Murphy games have made some significant contributions. The series' first installment, Mean Streets (1989), was among the earliest games to implement VGA graphics and the so-called RealSound technology that allowed the PC speaker to reproduce digitized sound effects and voice samples, as well as one of the first adventure games to offer an open 3D world to explore. Under a Killing Moon (1994) was the first adventure game with high-resolution, texture-mapped 3D graphics, and relied on extended full-motion movie cutscenes with live actors. Overseer (1997) was the first game developed to take advantage of DVD-ROM technology. 

In 2012, Big Finish Games, a developer founded by former Access Software employees, announced the development of the long-awaited sixth game in the series under the working title ""Project Fedora.""

"Commander Keen is a series of platform games developed by id Software. The protagonist of these games is an eight-year-old boy named Billy Blaze (his official name is William Joseph Blazkowicz). He is a genius who has built a spaceship called Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket from old soup cans. Throughout the series, he assumes the persona of Commander Keen, a football helmet-donning defender of the Earth who must thwart the world-dominating plans of his school rival Mortimer McMire. This often involves traveling to different planets and other hostile environments, and fighting aliens and other enemies.

Gameplay-wise, the series' defining features are Billy's ray gun with limited ammunition (which he uses to stun enemies permanently), and his pogo stick, which is used to jump twice as high. The games feature top-down overworld areas that connect between platforming stages, often allowing the player to explore them in a different order. Earlier games could only be saved in the overworld; the second trilogy, starting with Secret of the Oracle (1991), makes it possible to save anywhere and introduces several graphical and gameplay-related enhancements.",32,Commander Keen series

"Prince of Persia is a long-running series of action games with predominantly platform-oriented gameplay and puzzle-solving elements. The games are set in a fantasy version of Persia of an unspecified time period, though their stylistic elements reminiscent of the Arabian Nights tales indicate the Islamic Age. The protagonist is invariably the titular character; however, it is not entirely clear whether the Prince starring in each one of the games is the same person or not. Early Prince of Persia installments were designed by Jordan Mechner and developed by Brøderbund. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003), developed by Ubisoft Montreal, started its own overarching storyline featuring a distinct recurrent protagonist. 

The original Prince of Persia (1989) has had a considerable influence on the development of the platformer genre, contributing to the rise of cinematic platformers, in which the ""jump-and-run"" mechanics, common to the genre at that time, gave way to exploration, challenging combat, interaction with the environment, and puzzle-solving elements. The sequels emphasized and enhanced these features, in particular The Sands of Time, which introduced a re-designed gameplay system. The Prince relied on acrobatic manoeuvres to traverse the many hazards placed on his way; environmental puzzle-solving was given more attention. The Dagger of Time system has been carried over to subsequent games; it involved reversing time in order to re-gain another chance at tackling a difficult situation.",34,Prince of Persia series
"Quest for Glory is a series of role-playing/adventure hybrids originally published and developed by Sierra. 

The player takes on the role of a curly blond would-be hero, seeking fame and fortune in a fantasy world, imitating various countries and cultures, such as medieval Germany in Quest for Glory I: So You Want To Be A Hero, the Middle East in Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire, Africa in Quest for Glory III: Wages of War, Eastern Europe in Quest for Glory IV, and finally ancient Greece in Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire. Character may be imported from earlier versions to later versions of the game.

Gameplay

The gameplay in all the installments is a combination of traditional Sierra-style adventure and RPG. Visual style, navigation, and interface are identical to those of the adventure games that Sierra was developing parallel to the course of the series. Inventory-based puzzles, though less numerous, resembled the tasks introduced in other adventures. However, much of the gameplay's challenge also revolved around character development and combat. Battle systems in the series ranged from real-time fights, in which the player chose the desired actions (attacking, parrying, casting a spell, etc.), to side-scrolling action in the fourth game, and finally ""hack-and-slash"" action combat in the fifth.

Role-Playing System

The series originally introduced three classes: the Fighter, Magic-User, and the Thief. The character usually has to join a particular guild which in effect offers different plots in accordance to the class used by the player. In Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire the Paladin class was officially introduced and has since become the permanent fourth class. As expected in role-playing games, the character comes with a set of attributes and skills which may be increased by repeating certain actions. Many tasks and puzzles in the games can be solved in different ways, depending on the class the player has chosen.

Trivia

The series was originally entitled Hero's Quest. Its name was consequently changed due to intellectual property concerns with an already existing board game: Hero Quest, also adapted into a computer game series.",35,Quest for Glory series

"This group includes games set in the fictional Zork universe, starting with the text adventure Mainframe Zork (1977), developed by the students who would soon form Infocom. The aforementioned Empire is a vast subterranean complex with predominantly medieval fantasy elements. A complete chronology of this fictional realm has been provided by the authors; each game within the Zork universe is therefore set during a concrete pseudo-historical epoch. The games feature eccentric characters and objects, and are generally known for their humorous tone. Most games in the Zork universe are puzzle-solving text- or graphical adventures. The protagonists of the games are often nameless and speechless, representing the actual player on a journey through a magical world. 

Games in the Zork universe are divided into distinct sub-series. The first of those is the original trilogy of text adventures, which ended with Zork III: The Dungeon Master (1982). These games were followed by the Enchanter series, starting with Enchanter (1983) and ending with Spellbreaker (1985). Though set in the same universe, Enchanter games had a different overarching storyline of their own, and featured a different protagonist. The side-stories Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor (1987) and Zork Zero: The Revenge of Megaboz (1988) continued the text adventure formula, adding role-playing and/or graphical elements.

Afterwards, the series entered a six-year hiatus, which was broken by a final trilogy, opening with Return to Zork (1993), the first fully graphical Zork adventure, which also featured live actors. It was followed by Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Land (1996), with darker themes and gameplay system influenced by Myst, and eventually Zork: Grand Inquisitor (1997), the final installment of the main series (along with which ZTUU was released for free as a promotional giveaway, the final official Zork text-only game, released a decade after the most recent.)

The text adventure Wishbringer (1985) occupies an uncertain position within the universe, as only a few ties connect it to Zork games. The ZorkQuest games are ""interactive comic"" spin-offs, part of the InfoComics series, with similarly tenuous ties to the series canon. Also spin-off-y, Zork: the Cavern of Doom, though penned by an Implementor, presents a very different approach to the game world, with Choose-Your-Own-Adventure gameplay (befitting its original release as one of four print-and-paper Zork gamebooks.)

By the time the third graphical Zork adventure had come and gone, amateur homebrew text adventure authors had begun devising interactive fanfic homages to Infocom's then-recently-decoded Z-machine. Zork: A Troll's Eye View is as good an example of these as any. For nearly a decade, they would be the only activity of the dormant Zork brand. Then, in 2009, Activision officially licensed the name and fantasy-humour setting to Jolt Online Gaming, for their short-lived browser casual game Legends of Zork, which ran for just over two years before returning to live on solely as a legend.

Trivia

The original Zork trilogy inspired a fantasy novel that bore the Infocom logo. It was called The Zork Chronicles, and was written by Georg Alec Effinger, a past winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards. The book was published by Avon books in July, 1990.

"This series of first-person shooters developed by LucasArts and set in the Star Wars universe evolved from Star Wars: Dark Forces (1995); the sequels changed the main sub-title to Jedi Knight and gradually abandoned ""Dark Forces"" as part of their titles. These games have an overarching storyline, and most of them feature a common protagonist, the former Imperial officer Kyle Katarn, turned mercenary and then knight of the New Jedi Order.

The original Dark Forces was among the first story-driven first-person shooters, featuring cutscenes, mission objectives, and jumping as an important gameplay ability. The sequel, Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II (1997) added an optional third-person view, melee lightsaber combat, and the usage of Jedi Powers, all of which have since become recurrent gameplay elements in the series.

"The brainchild of the Collyer Brothers (Paul and Oliver), Championship Manager became the most popular football (soccer) management series during the 1990s, mostly thanks to the gigantic database that allowed many gamers born in countries outside the leagues usually covered by managing games (England, Spain, Germany, Scotland, Italy and France) the chance to coach their favourite clubs.

In 2004, Sports Interactive split with Eidos, which allowed Eidos to retain the name, and SI the database (which was used in their fresh new franchise, Football Manager). Development on the franchise was taken over by Beautiful Game Studios.

In October 2008, Beautiful Game Studios general manager Roy Meredith admitted that the franchise had suffered due to poor quality, and lacked vision and direction since the original team from Sports Interactive had left the series, with a promise to turn that around.

In December 2008, Championship Manager: Season 01/02 was released as freeware.

On 2 May 2022, the Championship Manager was sold as one of several franchises from Square Enix (as successors of Eidos) to the Embracer Group.

"Westwood Studios' long-running series of real-time strategy games (and expansion packs) set in alternate timelines featuring ongoing military conflict. When the company was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1998, it became a brand of EA. It was later picked up by multiple other Electronic Arts subsidiaries, most notably Electronic Arts Pacific and Electronic Arts Los Angeles' RTS division which was made from the former.

The games' design originally evolved from Westwood's previous RTS, the 1992 Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty.

Cancelled titles

This series has a large number of titles which were known to be in production, but were cancelled before they could be finished, or even pass the concept stage.



Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade 2 - while unannounced, multiple concepts, loose 3D assets, and early video footage exist. Cancelled by 2003, as Battlefield 1942 overshadowed the sales of the original Renegade.

Command &amp; Conquer: Continuum - also unannounced; MMO set in the Tiberium universe. Cancelled by 2002 in order for staff to assist with Earth &amp; Beyond. Scarce animations survived.

Command &amp; Conquer 3: Incursion - after the release of Tiberian Sun, Westwood attempted to make a third mainline Tiberium universe game twice. A third project was started by EA Los Angeles soon after the Westwood and EA Pacific merged with it, while Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars from 2007 was actually the fourth attempt at making a game with that title.

Tiberium - announced in October 2008 by EA Los Angeles, it was supposed to be a squad first-person shooter set after the Third Tiberium War, and the player controlling GDI officer Ricardo Vega, nephew of a Nod's warlord from Tiberian Sun. After a delay to FY 2010, the game was cancelled by EA for not meeting their standards.

Project Camacho - working title of a first-person tactical shooter in the Generals universe by EA Los Angeles. Cancelled in 2009, but some concepts survived.

Command &amp; Conquer: Arena - not officially announced; it was in development in 2008/2009 at EA Los Angeles as an experimental multiplayer-only spin-off of Command &amp; Conquer 3 meant for the Asian market. Only select concept art and an unpublished CGI trailer survived, while the developed assets were converted into Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight (2010) by order of EA.

Command &amp; Conquer: Battles - project was at least in concept stage around 2010 by EA2D, with mockups using assets from their title AWOL

Command &amp; Conquer - originally announced as Command &amp; Conquer: Generals 2 in December 2010 by Victory Games, the game was supposed to be the first Generals sequel and use the Frostbite 2 engine (later migrated to Frostbite 3). In 2012, it was announced to move to a free-to-play model and a transfer to a live service system called only Command &amp; Conquer, where Generals 2 content would be the first game of a planned multitude of titles. After several design changes, a prolonged closed alpha stage, the game was cancelled and the studio closed in October 2013 due to internal corporate politics at EA.

mobile port of Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberium Alliances - known to have been in development by late December 2012 - cancelled due to the closure of EA Phenomic in July 2013

Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert Alliances - was to be similar to Tiberium Alliances - project bible was made mere days before EA Phenomic was closed in July 2013

untitled mobile game by Mythic - cancelled in 2014, but the project was unknown until 2018, when its artists used its concepts for their personal portfolios

"Tomb Raider is a series of action games with platforming and puzzle-solving elements, featuring a recurrent heroine, an archaeologist named Lara Croft. Most of the games in the series involve Lara traversing complex and hazardous locations, solving environmental puzzles and using abilities such as jumping and climbing to access new areas. Lara's trademark weapons are twin pistols with unlimited ammunition; however, she can usually find other weapons and items to help her deal with enemies.

The first game in the series appeared in 1996; building upon the concept of early Prince of Persia games, it is considered one of the progenitors of 3D platformers. The game was followed by numerous sequels and additional versions for handheld and mobile systems, as well as compilations. Lara and the games' backgrounds have since been adapted into three major Hollywood movies, which starred Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander as the main actresses.

Known cancelled games



Star Wars: Ewok Adventure was planned to be released by Parker Brothers for the Atari 2600 in 1983 but was cancelled. However a prototype of the game still exists.

Hal Barwood, the game designer behind titles such as Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, had an idea of a Star Wars adventure game that ""was going to involve a lot of very expensive pre-rendered 3D sets"", but since Grim Fandango (also utilizing a lot of pre-rendered sets) was already in development at LucasArts, the president of the company felt uneasy about doing two games that way and the idea was buried.

A third-person action-adventure game titled Star Wars: 1313 was in development in the early 2010s, and was revealed publicly at E3 2012. The game was cancelled when LucasArts' development team was closed by The Walt Disney Company on 3 April 2013.

A first-person shooter with a Mandalorian protagonist was in development by Respawn Entertainment in the early 2020s, but was cancelled on 28 February 2024.

"Ultima series contains all main (numbered) Ultima RPGs. They are set mainly in a fictional medieval Europe-like world called Britannia, and are connected by the same protagonist, a nameless person from the Earth, who in Ultima IV becomes the Avatar, an incarnation of virtue. One of the most influential RPG series, Ultima games are notable for open-ended gameplay, detailed interaction, and in-depth morality system. 

Story

Created by Richard Garriott and developed by Origin, the series has undergone several phases, also known as Ages. Each Age is a trilogy of games connected by common main creative ideas and overarching story. 

The Age of Darkness encompasses the first three games of the series (sometimes also counting their precursor  Akalabeth). The protagonist is referred to as ""Stranger""; similarly to other role-playing game heroes, his goal is to stop an evil antagonist and save the world. The land which the Stranger liberates in the first and third game (the second one takes place on the Earth) is called Sosaria.

The Age of Enlightenment is seen by many as the turning point of the series, where its characteristic philosophy and design goals were manifested for the first time. The remnants of Sosaria have become a new world named Britannia, ruled by the benevolent monarch Lord British, and sustained by the Eight Virtues derived from the combination of the Three Principles: Love, Truth, and Courage. The fourth game is dedicated entirely to the Stranger's quest to become the Avatar, an incarnation of these virtues. The fifth sees the virtues misinterpreted and twisted by the tyrant Blackthorn; the Avatar must rescue the imprisoned Lord British and restore the virtues to their original meanings. In the sixth game, the Avatar is to find a way to make peace between the inhabitants of Britannia and the race of gargoyles.

The final age of Ultima is called The Age of Armageddon; it is also known as The Guardian Saga. The seventh game introduces a new enemy of Britannia, a mysterious and powerful being known as the Guardian. The second part of the seventh game is set on Serpent Isle, another remnant of Sosaria; tracking down the leaders of a dangerous organization called The Fellowship, the Avatar learns the history and the ethical principles of the new world. The eighth game takes the Avatar to a hostile world called Pagan, controlled by the Guardian. Finally, in the ninth and last installment of the series, the Avatar returns to Britannia to defeat the Guardian once and for all.

Gameplay

The gameplay of the series has undergone significant changes during its course. Traditionally, Ultima games used turn-based combat with free movement on the battle field, and a leveling system similar to other role-playing games (the highest level usually being 8). Conversations with NPCs were carried out by typing key words. Characters who joined the hero's party for personal reasons (rather than being created by the player or hired as mercenaries in the game world) were one of the innovations implemented in Ultima IV; it also featured for the first time the characteristic spellcasting system based on mixing reagents. Ultima V introduced a higher level of interactivity with visible objects, and Ultima VI pioneered in creating a seamless world, with towns and wilderness areas integrated into a graphically homogeneous whole. Ultima games were open-ended up to that point; objectives could be accomplished in any order by carefully and meticulously gathering information from the world's inhabitants and finding crucial objects required to complete the quest.

Ultima VII introduced real-time combat with automated actions for party members, as well as physical (drag-and-drop) interaction with the world. Non-linear accomplishment of objectives was integrated as well. The game's second part, Serpent Isle, retained all of its gameplay features, but opted for a significantly more linear story development. Ultima VIII was perhaps the most drastic change in the series gameplay-wise, abandoning the party-based combat of earlier games in favor of action RPG mechanics, including the abilities to jump and climb. Ultima IX reduced role-playing elements even further, but enhanced the interaction with the environment by implementing 3D graphics and adding the ability to swim to the other physical activities.

The series has spawned many spin-offs, most notable of them being the two first-person 3D RPGs that formed the Ultima Underworld series. All these spin-offs are included in the Ultima Universe group.

Joe Wampole, one of the developers, posted the following reply in the BloodRayne.uk.co fan forums:
&gt; Durham Red looks like a cool character but we've never heard of her. It is coincidence that her and BloodRayne look so similar. The symbol on the hair is similar but looks more like a target, while Rayne's looks a little like Prince's symbol. Also, it looks like Durham is set in some alternate super sci-fi future. I think it is just natural to put a vamp chick in black leather and either color her hair black or red

Trivia

"System Shock games were notable for incorporating elements of first-person shooter, puzzle-solving, and role-playing.

Released in 1994, System Shock was based on the engine implemented in Ultima Underworld. Similarly to that game, System Shock strived to represent realistic physical interaction in a 3D world. Though similar to other first-person shooters in terms of basic gameplay mechanics, the game's pace was nevertheless quite different, requiring the player to carefully explore the environment, collecting clues and crucial items in process. Objectives, character customization, and interaction with the game world exceeded by far the customary requirements of contemporary shooters, infusing the game with role-playing elements.

System Shock 2 (1999) further emphasized the role-playing angle, effectively becoming a FPS/RPG hybrid. The player could customize and enhance the player's parameters, affecting gameplay style and offering diverse solutions to the tasks. Both games implemented an unusual storytelling technique, gradually uncovering past events by encouraging the player to look for messages and logs left by people before the disasters occurred.",103,System Shock series

"Wizardry is a series of role-playing games originally developed by Sir-tech. The first game, Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord (1981), is widely considered one of the progenitors of the genre, alongside Ultima. The game required the player to create a party of six characters, selecting between races and classes influenced by D&amp;D scenarios. The player then explored a maze-like pseudo-3D dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. Subsequent installments were for the most part based on this template.

Wizardry introduced the concept of prestige classes, allowing the player to create versatile and powerful characters belonging to the classes of bishop, lord, ninja, samurai, and valkyrie, available only through large quantities of bonus points received at dice rolls, or by switching to them during the course of the game. The initial entries were set in a traditional fantasy environment with the races typical for the setting; later games incorporated science fiction elements and added exotic playable races such as lizardman, dracon, the feline Felpurr, the canine Rawulf, and the mysterious alien-like Mook.

The first installments in the series were created by Robert Woodhead and Andrew Greenberg. David Bradley was brought to the team as the lead designer of Heart of the Maelstrom (1988). However, it was mainly in Bane of the Cosmic Forge (1990) where his ideas were fully realized, making that entry a turning point in the series with its new skill system, magic disciplines, and a more refined interaction with NPCs. The main series ended with the release of Wizardry 8 (2001), the last Wizardry game developed by Sir-tech. However, several spin-offs designed by Japanese developers were released afterwards.

Early Wizardry games had a considerable influence on the development of role-playing games. In particular, they proved to be popular in Japan, influencing early Xtalsoft RPGs, Dragon Quest and to a certain extent Phantasy Star. Random enemy encounters and party turn-based combat mechanics eventually became the staple element of the Japanese RPG genre.

This group includes the main series as well as spin-offs.

The first game in the series was Arena (1994), which introduced the series' lore, themes, and main gameplay-related and visual elements, including 3D environments and first-person view.

Setting

Most of the games in the series take place on the continent of Tamriel; on a few occasions the setting shifts to Oblivion, a dark realm ruled by the immortal Daedra Princes. The continent of Tamriel is divided into nine provinces, some of which (e.g. Morrowind) may constitute the setting of an entire game in the series. These provinces are inhabitants by various races; some of these are human (Imperial, Bretons, etc.), while others represent either popular fantasy (Orcs, Dark Elves) or original creatures (reptilian Argonians and feline Khajiit). The central province of Cyrodiil is ruled by the Empire.

Gameplay

The role-playing games in the series have many common features. Elder Scrolls games are known for having vast worlds which can be usually explored by the player without restrictions. Exploration takes precedence over scripted, story-advancing events; the player is for the most part free to undertake any quests and join any faction without plot-related repercussions. Typically, the bulk of side missions occupies a considerably larger space than the main quest.

Combat in Elder Scrolls RPGs is action-oriented; though in some of the games non-playable characters may join the protagonist and fight on his and her side, the core mechanics revolve around a single controllable character. One of the series' most distinguishing features is its skill-based character-building. Instead of accumulating experience points, the protagonist becomes more proficient in various skills (weapon and armor specializations, stealth, jumping, bartering, etc.) if the player repeatedly executes the correspondent actions. Leveling up typically occurs after certain primary skill requirement for the character class chosen by the player have been met.

"Might and Magic is a series of first-person fantasy role-playing games originally developed by New World Computing. Together with Wizardry and Ultima, it is considered a major franchise in Western RPG development that helped to shape the genre in its early stages.

Early Might and Magic games relied on the Wizardry template, focusing on dungeon crawling and featuring party creation with characters belonging to various classes and fantasy races, random enemies, and turn-based combat. Compared to Wizardry games, they featured larger outdoor areas and more free-form exploration. Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven (1998) moved away from random enemy encounters, introduced real-time combat with dynamic movement while allowing to switch to traditional stationary turn-based battles at any time, and implemented a manual leveling system with skill point distribution. All these elements were retained in subsequent installments.

Most Might and Magic installments have an overarching plot that contains elements of science fiction. It focuses on a group of powerful space travelers known as the Ancients, whose long-lasting battle against the alien race Kreegan has caused many worlds to be cut off from advanced technology. In the first five games, the player-controlled party of heroes tracks down Sheltem, the corrupt guardian of Earth. The sixth game starts a story arc set on the planet Enroth, which allows a closer look at the war between the Ancients and the Kreegan.

The series has also gave birth to spin-offs, most notably the Heroes of Might and Magic series of strategy games.",128,Might and Magic series
"Developed by Raven Software, this series of 3D shooters set in a medieval fantasy world has an overarching story which includes both Heretic and Hexen titles, uniting all games with these names into one series. 

The first Heretic (1994) used the Doom (id Tech 1) engine to re-create first-person shooter gameplay in a medieval fantasy world, and added new gameplay features such as an inventory. Hexen (1995) expanded customization and exploration, introducing three playable character classes and hub levels. This tendency culminated in Hexen II (1997), which had strong RPG elements such as character attributes and experience points. Heretic II (1998), on the other hand, returned to the simpler systems of the earlier games and also switched the perspective from first- to third-person.

Westerns as a game style are generally associated with cowboys and take place in the Old West (the western half of the continental United States of America). Many common themes involve the European colonization of America (roughly the 16th to late 19th centuries) and the frontier towns established or simply a depiction of vastness out on the range away from civilization and urbanization.

Limitations



For the purposes of this game group, there is an emphasis on traditional, meaning that it must be a true western without any genre-blending. For example, Wild Wild West and Wild Guns do not qualify, because of their alternate-universe and sci-fi elements, respectively. These have a separate group: Non-traditional Westerns.

"This group contains official games featuring the character Duke Nukem. The character was conceived as a generic representation of the action hero stereotype, such as those portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger (whom Duke resembles visually) or the character Ash Williams from the Evil Dead series of movies. He has gradually evolved from a tough, yet silent Earth-saving hero to a primitive, fairly violent man known for his politically incorrect remarks. Humorous elements began with Duke Nukem II (1993), portraying Duke as the author of a book entitled Why I Am So Great and increased in later installments, with deliberately crude and offensive humor prevailing.

The first installments of the long-running franchise were 2D platform shooters developed by Apogee Software. With the 3D first-person shooter Duke Nukem 3D (1996) by 3D Realms, the series have achieved widespread popularity. Some of the subsequent independent installments (besides add-ons and level packs), however, favored third-person shooter gameplay with platforming elements or returned to the series' 2D platforming roots.

In September 2010, Gearbox Software announced that it owns the rights to the Duke Nukem character and franchise.

Trivia  

The character Duke Nukem was parodied in an episode of Die Redaktion (the Editorial Team), a monthly comedy video produced by the German gaming magazine GameStar. It was published on the DVD of issue 12/2010.

"Grand Theft Auto (usually abbreviated GTA) is a series of games that incorporate driving and action gameplay styles. Created by the British developer Rockstar North (then under the name DMA Design), GTA games are set in vast, predominantly urban ""sandbox"" environments, and feature protagonists involved in organized crime. The distinguishing feature of the games is the possibility to hijack and drive most vehicles encountered in the game world. With the exception of the expansion packs to the first Grand Theft Auto, which are set in London in the 1960's, all GTA games are set in the USA, in fictional cities modeled after real-world locations such as New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and others.

Themes

The first Grand Theft Auto (1997) and its sequel were done with top-down 2D graphics, and put the player into the role of a criminal performing tasks for various organized crime lords and advancing in their ranks. Subsequent games also followed this structure, but notable enhancements were made to story-related content. The two initial games were nearly devoid of narrative and lacked characters with distinct personalities. This has changed with the advent of Grand Theft Auto III (2001), the series' first fully 3D installment, which introduced storyline and characterization, and also set the gameplay template used in subsequent releases. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) further emphasized narrative, increasing the series' tendency towards satire, social and political critique, parody, and black humor. Later releases became more focused on morally ambiguous heroes (compared to the entirely ruthless protagonists of earlier installments), adding personal and dramatic elements to the storytelling.

Structure and gameplay

A typical GTA gameplay experience consists of exploring a virtual city in a vehicle or on foot, triggering story-advancing missions by navigating the protagonist to specific locations. The mission structure in the games has a fair degree of non-linearity, i.e. the player can often choose the order in which he/she wishes to undertake the missions. The player is usually required to complete most of the given missions in order to trigger new ones, eventually leading to the conclusion of the narrative, though optional missions are also present.

Most missions involve driving a vehicle to a specific destination, which often leads to a shooting sequence. However, many missions in GTA games have mini-game-like structures, with varied tasks including (but not limited to) racing against time or an opponent, drive-by shooting, sniping, navigating vehicles other than cars (motorcycles, helicopters, boats, airplanes, and others), stealthy following of an opponent, and so on.

Outside of the missions, the player can engage in various activities. Money can be earned by working as a taxi driver or delivering sick people to hospital in an ambulance car. Different kinds of firearms and body armor can be purchased in shops. In most later installments, the protagonists can also buy and change clothes, engage the services of prostitutes, and purchase apartments and houses. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004) added more activities, such as dating female characters, increasing stamina in gyms, eating, and changing hair styles. It also included rural environments in the setting and introduced the ability to swim and dive.

Influence

Grand Theft Auto III has had considerable influence on video game development, leading to increased interest and production of games with similar thematics and gameplay mechanics. The popular term ""GTA clone"" refers to story-driven, 3D action games set in open-ended urban environments, usually incorporating violent and criminal themes, in which players are given the ability to drive any vehicle and attack any characters. Among the series influenced by GTA are Mafia, The Getaway, True Crime, Saints Row and others.

Records

The 2008 edition of Guinness World Records named Grand Theft Auto the Most Controversial Video Game Series. Over 4,000 stories news stories have been published about it, with accusations ranging from glamorized violence, alleged connection with real-life crimes, and the presumed corruption of gamers. Numerous lawsuits have also been leveled against the publisher Rockstar Games. 

Sales

In November 2012, Take-Two Interactive announced that the Grand Theft Auto series reached 125 million units shipped. In September 2011, that number was 114 million.

Later games in the series usually feature the character Jake Peril as he fights against the Mad Monks.

Most of the games in the series have gameplay that typically revolves around the player collecting gold on multi-storied platforms while running away from their pursuers. Players can usually set traps for their enemies by digging holes into the ground thus temporarily capturing them in pits.

"Half-Life is a series of games developed by Valve, which share a common setting and recurrent gameplay elements. The main installments are predominantly linear, story-driven first-person shooters with light puzzle-solving elements, connected by an overarching storyline and a common protagonist, the scientist Gordon Freeman. Half-Life: Alyx features Alyx Vance as the protagonist;  Vance originally appeared in Half-Life 2. Portal games, originating in 2007, are set in the same universe and share a few gameplay elements with the main Half-Life games, though they form a separate storyline and are mostly dedicated to puzzle-solving. 

Story

The overarching story of Half-Life begins in the fictional Black Mesa Research Facility in New Mexico, where a failed experiment leads to the opening of an inter-dimensional portal, causing alien beings from the world Xen to invade Earth. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist, escapes from the facility and attempts to stop the alien invasion, eliminating their leader. However, he is confronted by a mysterious person known as the G-man, who puts him into stasis. Nearly twenty years later, Freeman finds himself in City 17, a dystopian society governed by the Combine, a group of humans and aliens who have meanwhile used the dimensional rift to conquer the Earth. Freeman and his friends begin a struggle against Combine, still unaware of the G-man's true intentions.

Gameplay

Half-Life games are for the most part composed of straightforward first-person shooter gameplay. However, some of the tasks in the games require specific actions, sometimes resulting in moderate platform exercises (jumping) and mild puzzle-solving activities. The games include many scripted events and action-oriented set pieces, complementing their linear nature. The first Half-Life (1998) was also notable for popularizing seamless cutscenes, during which the player's control of the main character was retained.

"Myst is a series of adventure games originally created by the brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, and developed by Cyan, Inc.. Myst games are played from a first-person perspective and place a strong emphasis on complex puzzles.

Setting and Story

Myst games are set in fictional realms known as Ages, which can be created and accessed by writing and using the so-called ""linking books"". The practice of writing such books originated with an ancient race known as D'ni, who had arrived on the Earth over ten thousand years ago, and founded a thriving civilization in its underground caverns. However, this culture was destroyed by a terrible disease that annihilated almost the entire D'ni population. Among the few survivors was Gehn, the son of a D'ni man and a native Earth woman. Gehn's son, Atrus, is one of the central characters in the games, responsible for the linking books that guide the nameless protagonist (referred to as ""Stranger"") to various Ages, where he has to uncover secrets of the past and undo the wrongs done by some of the members of Atrus' family.

Gameplay

Myst games eschew, partially or completely, some traditional adventure game elements, such as conversations with characters populating the game world, puzzles based on using and combining inventory items, verb-based interaction with the environments, and text descriptions prompted by it. The worlds of Myst games are largely unpopulated. The puzzles are noticeably more complex and demanding than in most other adventure games, and are almost entirely logic-based, the player needing to apply his/her perception and understanding of logical, mathematical, and sometimes sound-related procedures to figure out principles and mechanics of the many exotic devices encountered in the game world. Interaction with the game world is performed simply by pointing and clicking the mouse on objects. Traditionally, Myst games utilize pre-rendered backgrounds, and character navigation in them consists of ""jumping"" from one still screen to another. However, some installments, such as Real Myst (2000), the remake of the original Myst, feature fully 3D graphics with physical navigation and camera rotation.

Influence

The original Myst (1993) had a significant influence on the development of adventure games, popularizing the slow-paced, meditative, and intellectually challenging gameplay, which was opposed to the more lively, whimsical, and humorous nature of most other adventures. The term ""Myst clone"" usually refers to subsequent adventure games that utilized a similar visual presentation, navigation, and puzzle-related challenge, such as for example Shivers (1995) or Zork: Nemesis (1996). This influence is seen by many as negative, since the adherence of adventure game developers to the design philosophy of Myst conflicted with the growing popularity of more action-oriented games and contributed to the decline of the adventure genre.

The series feature a common protagonist, a thief named Garrett, formerly a member of an organization known as the Keepers.

Setting

Thief games are set in a dense metropolitan complex referred to as simply ""The City"". The stories of most games in the series revolve around conflicts between various organizations within The City and its surroundings. A major faction in the games is the Order of the Hammer, a religious group who zealously pursues its ideals of technological progress. The Mechanists split from the Hammerite religion, forming a faction that disregarded morality and fully devoted itself to construction of technological devises. Both groups are hostile towards the Pagans, who worship a deity named Trickster, promote chaos and distortion, and are opposed to technology. The organization of the Keepers is the most mysterious one; self-described as ancient observers called to preserve the balance in the world, they employ extreme secrecy and a strict hierarchy in their ranks, which made Garrett distance himself from them.

Gameplay

Thief games traditionally use first-person perspective. The gameplay of all the installments in the series is heavily stealth-based. Direct confrontation with hostile characters often leads to Garrett's demise, though in many cases Garrett can opt for a violent solution, usually when facing a single enemy without backup. Light and sound are used extensively in the games as integral gameplay elements. The player must usually carefully navigate Garrett, trying to stay in shadows and avoiding open areas. Sounds made by hostile characters serve to warn the player, while sounds made by Garrett himself may alert guards, putting him in danger. 

Garrett can use melee weapons such as a sword to engage enemies in combat; a preferred course of action, however, often proves to be sneaking behind the character and striking him unconscious with a blackjack. Garrett can also shoot various types of arrows, for combat (fire arrows), reaching otherwise inaccessible locations (rope arrows), or to serve the stealth purposes (water arrows to extinguish fires, moss arrows to create a soft carpet that decreases the sound of footsteps, etc.).",188,Thief series

Games Based on the Movies  

Due to the theme of the movies it may seem natural that most games in this game group are action games. The first movie, however, spawned a Pac Man variant and a  strategy game where the player manages the ship crew. The second movie Aliens also inspired varied games: a genre mix which includes different mini games like flying or mazes, a first person action game, a side-scrolling action game.

The different games based on the third movie however Alien³ (NES, SNES and other systems) are all side-scrolling action games, save for the Game Boy version which is played in a top-down view. Two later released first person shooters are Alien trilogy based on the first three movies and Alien Resurrection based on the eponymous fourth movie. 

Games Based on the Alien Universe  

There are also other games which belong to this group but are not directly based on the movies: Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure is a adventure game based on the comic books and Aliens Online was an online-only multiplayer shooter.

"This group contains the main (numbered) Mega Man games (Rockman in Japan). The plot of these games takes place in the year 20XX. A scientist, Dr. Light, converted his worker robot, Rock, into a fighting robot, known as Mega Man. Mega Man fights an endless battle against the mad scientist, Dr. Wily, and the robots he creates. Mega Man's special talent is that he can steal the powers of any robot boss that he defeats and use it for himself. Games in the Mega Man series are platformers, distinguished by a recurrent feature of non-linear level progression: the player is typically able to choose to play through the game's stages in any order.

Trivia

Inspiration

One of the concepts in the game by the creator Keiji Inafune, was a rock, paper, scissors concept in showing that every weapon and Robot Master has a strength and a weakness. 

Megabit Size

Mega Man is 1 megabit in size, Mega Man 2 is 2 megabits, Mega Man 3 is 3 megabits, and Mega Man 4 is 4 megabits. However, this pattern doesn't continue any longer after that since Mega Man 5 and Mega Man 6 are also both 4 megabits.

Mega Man



When Capcom was producing the first game in the series, there were several names considered for the main character. Knuckles Kid was one suggestion, as was Rainbow Man (because the main character changed colors whenever he used a different weapon). They finally went with the name Rockman, which was changed to Mega Man when the game was released in the United States and Europe.

Mega Man made his first and regular animated appearance in the Saturday morning TV cartoon Captain N: The Game Master. He later had his own animated series and a comic book.


Sales

According to publisher Capcom, the Mega Man franchise, numbering 131 titles across several mediums including films and arcade machines, has sold around 30 million units worldwide (as of June 31, 2015).

Spiritual successor

A Kickstarter for a side-scrolling action game titled Mighty No. 9 was created by Keiji Inafune and his company Comcept. Due to the similarities between this game and the Mega Man series, it makes sense that most people would consider this a continuation of the Mega Man legacy.

"Games that belong in the WarCraft universe designed by Blizzard. This series originally was a real-time fantasy strategy game detailing a brutal war between the Human Alliance and Orcish Horde in Eastern Kingdoms of the planet Azeroth. 

The universe later expanded to introduce other continents in Azeroth (even more so through World of WarCraft), such as Kalimdor and Northrend in WarCraft III: Reign of Chaos, the Outland in WarCraft III: Frozen Throne, as well as other planets such as Draenor, the original home of Orcs and Ogres, featured in WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.

An RPG-like version was first introduced through an official scenario in WarCraft III: Reign of Chaos, where the player may control only one hero, this eventually led to a more serious RPG project: World of WarCraft. 

As the series progressed, new creatures, civilizations and magical manipulation appeared. New races such as the Undead Scourge, the Night Elves, Tauren, the Burning Legion, Naga, etc., beings to play a more prominent role in the overall plot (although not all of them are selectable during gameplay or are incorporated within the selectable races the RTS version of WarCraft).

There was also an adventure game in development, Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans, but it was cancelled in 1998. However, a build from late in development was leaked in 2016. More information about it is available here.

"Developed by  NovaLogic, Inc, the Comanche series of games are flight simulators focusing on the RAH-66 Comanche attack helicopter which would have become the successor of the famous AH64 Apache. The games allow the player to pilot a Comanche through numerous military missions and terrains and engage in both aerial and ground combat.

Since the Comanche project has been cancelled by the US military on February 23, 2004 (the total cost of the project ran up to an estimated 6.9 billion dollars and only two prototype helicopters were ever produced), it appears unlikely that new installments of the series will be produced.

In 2016 THQ Nordic bought NovaLogic Inc, bringing IPs such as the Comanche series under their wing.

"A series of games which puts you in the middle of a comedy game show known as ""You Don't Know Jack.""  The central theme of the game is that it combines high culture (art, literature, history, the sciences) and pop culture (television, movies, video games, music, trivia).  For example, one question might take Homer the Poet and Homer Simpson and use them to create a question about corporal punishment.  Sometimes, however, a specific game in the series may focus on one theme in particular, such as the movies.

Emphasis is placed on the series' humorous appeal, especially with its quick, witty dialog, its sarcastic game show host, and the often bizarre situations that occur on the show itself.  The series uses very little visuals and mostly utilizes audio recordings to illustrate the idea that players are on the set of a game show.",204,You Don't Know Jack series

"Diablo is a series of fantasy-themed action role-playing games by Blizzard. The games draw inspiration from roguelikes by focusing on extensive dungeon crawling and having randomized environments, enemies, and items. However, unlike true roguelikes, Diablo games have action-oriented combat with simple point-and-click mechanics, and eschew the permanent death feature. The combination of these elements along with its prominent online multiplayer gameplay has had a considerable influence on the video game industry, creating a sub-genre commonly referred to as Diablo variants.

"Legacy of Kain is a series of action games with puzzle-solving elements, united by a common setting and overarching storyline. The first game, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain (1996), was created by Silicon Knights; subsequent installments were developed by Crystal Dynamics. The series was initially split into two branches, one continuing the story of the vampire lord Kain, the protagonist of the first game, and the other featuring his ex-lieutenant, the vampire wraith Raziel, as the protagonist. These storylines were merged in Legacy of Kain: Defiance (2003), in which the player controls both Kain and Raziel.

Setting and story

Legacy of Kain games are set in a dark medieval fantasy world known as Nosgoth. This world has for a long time been a battleground of two powerful races - the Ancient Vampires and the Hylden. Eventually, the vampires were able to overpower the Hylden, banishing them to another dimension. The Pillars of Nosgoth were erected, preventing the Hylden from returning, protected by the Nine Guardians. However, the Hylden are still able to manifest themselves physically in Nosgoth by possessing other creatures. As the power of the Pillars is weakening, the Hylden are trying to manipulate the inhabitants of Nosgoth into opening the gate to their world.

The story of the first game opens with Kain, a mortal turned vampire, on a quest for revenge against his slayer. Notable for its complexity, the overarching story is carried across all installments, with Kain (and later Raziel) often being unaware of the true intentions of those they meet on their path, resulting in unexpected consequences of their actions. Time traveling is also present in the series, often leading to paradoxes and changes in its fictional history.

Gameplay

Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain was a top-down 2D action game with light role-playing and puzzle-solving elements, somewhat similar to Zelda games. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (1999), the first installment to star Raziel, signified a transition to 3D, with a more sophisticated combat system, extended puzzle-solving, and addition of environmental action (platforming); subsequent releases built, for the most part, upon the gameplay template introduced by it.",281,Legacy of Kain series

"Baldur's Gate is a role-playing franchise released under the Dungeons &amp; Dragons video game license. The games take place in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, on the fictional continent Faerûn. 

The series started with Baldur's Gate (1998), eventually evolving into two distinct sub-series. The so-called Bhaalspawn Saga, developed by BioWare, includes the first game, its sequel Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (2000), and their expansion packs, most notably Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal (2001), which concludes the overarching story. The games in the Bhaalspawn Saga are party-based RPGs with tactical real-time combat.

The Dark Alliance series initiated with Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance (2001), and are action RPGs with ""hack-and-slash"" tendencies, unrelated to the Bhaalspawn Saga story-wise. Developed by Snowblind Studios and Black Isle Studios, this series is often considered a spin-off of the former, due to its console-exclusive releases, reduced RPG elements, and projects of continuing the series in the gameplay vein of the first two games.

The first Baldur's Gate is commonly regarded as one of the significant contributors to the RPG revival of the late 1990's, the others being Diablo (1996) and Fallout (1997). It introduced the Infinity Engine, which served as a basis for several other isometric role-playing games, and popularized the ""real-time-with-pause"" combat system, which has been since implemented in many party-based Western RPGs. 

Black Isle announced another Baldur's Gate title in 2001, Baldur's Gate 3: The Black Hound, but it was canceled in 2003. The game was supposed to implement a gameplay system similar to the one of the Bhaalspawn Saga, while starting an entirely new storyline. According to lead designer Josh Sawyer, it started development as a completely unrelated game, but Interplay lost the rights to make Dungeons &amp; Dragons games outside the Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate and Dark Alliance franchise. In order to continue development, they had to re-brand it as a Baldur's Gate game.

A proper Baldur's Gate III was released by Larian Studios in 2020 as an early access title, and as a full product in 2023, to universal acclaim.

It also included other features, such as detailed team and player profile, the ability to follow the real Spanish league inside the game by downloading weekly information or inputting results and complete historical results of both Spanish and European competitions. Along the yearly editions, three editions following the Spanish national team were released for the 1996 and 2000 European Championships and the 1998 World Cup.

Highly popular and fiercely defended by the Spanish press, the game was also known in Portugal and South American countries, having sold over one million copies at the time of Dinamic's demise. In other markets, the names Premier Manager (97, 98 and Ninety Nine) and Euro League Football was the closest available to the original Spanish products.

Following Dinamic's closure in 2001, the series were dormant until in 2004 Gaelco acquired the rights of the name and brought some former Dinamic employees such as key programmer Marcos Jourón.

"Created by Oddworld Inhabitants, Oddworld is a fictional universe and a series of games set in it. Most Oddworld games combine platforming gameplay with puzzle-solving. Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath (2005) is often considered a spin-off, since it is more oriented towards shooting gameplay and also has setting-related differences. However, all Oddworld games are united by the common lore of their fictional world.

Setting

Oddworld is a planet populated by various races, some humanoid, some resembling animals. The main continent is called Mudos; the most prominently represented race in the games are the Mudokons; the main protagonist of most Oddworld games, Abe, belongs to that race. Among the frequently appearing races are Sligs, Slogs, Paramites, Gabbits, Vykkers, and others - all of various degrees of intelligence and friendliness. One of the main conflicts depicted in the games is that between the Mudokons and the power-hungry, corporate Glukkons; the goal of Abe and other protagonists is usually to free enslaved Mudokons from the clutches of Glukkon leaders and their assistants.

Gameplay

Most Oddworld games have a puzzle-oriented approach towards platforming gameplay, similar to that of ""cinematic platformers"", in particular Another World (1991). A recurrent gameplay feature of the series is the relative helplessness of its protagonists. They are usually unable to use effective weapons, and must rely on cunning and stealth to avoid traps and outsmart the more powerful foes. Objects such as stones, chunks of meat, etc., can be used to distract enemies; Abe can also possess enemies and manipulate them to perform required tasks or simply attack each other.

A distinguishing gameplay element of Oddworld games is the so-called GameSpeak. Abe and other protagonists can communicate with some of the characters in the game by uttering simple phrases, noises, or combinations thereof. These can be used to give orders to friendly creatures, lead enemies into traps with possessed characters, memorize passwords, etc. 

Trivia

Reception

Praised for their originality, the Oddworld games, Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus, and Munch's Oddysee, are winners of nearly 100 industry and magazine awards, including 3 Gold Medals for Best Computer Generated Images at the 2002 New York Festivals Awards.

According to the magazine Retro Gamer (issue #2), there were plans to make an animated TV show out of the series in 1992, but it fell through because partner Hanna-Barbara thought the character was not popular enough worldwide.

In 2012, the Oliver twins started a Kickstarter for a new Dizzy game titled Dizzy Returns. The £350,000 goal fell short with only 839 backers pledging £25,620 and thus this planned return of Dizzy was ultimately scrapped.

The games are set in the pen &amp; paper RPG universe of The Dark Eye (German: Das Schwarze Auge) and implement its rules. A fourth game, Armalion, was in development but not completed when publisher Ikarion Software GmbH ran into financial trouble.

The three games share the same setting, basic gameplay and role-playing system. They are set in the Northern regions of the medieval fantasy world of Arkania, populated by humans and fantasy races, some common (dwarves, elves, etc.), other exclusive to this universe (such as the half-elf, half-orc Holberkians). The overarching story of the series focuses on a party of adventurers protecting the people of the land from orcs.

First-person perspective is used for navigating the environments; initially done in pseudo-3D, they became fully three-dimensional over the course of the series. Combat takes place on separate isometric screens and is turn-based; the player can navigate the characters over the battle field and take into account weapon and spell range.

Realms of Arkania games are known for their complex character creation and micro-management. The player is encouraged to create his or her own party of six adventurers. Instead of the usual division into classes and races, the characters are categorized into ""archetypes"", which include occupations such as Jester, Hunter, or Warlock along with racial traits, e.g. various types of elves. Characters have seven ""positive"" (Courage, Wisdom, Charisma, Intuition, Strength, Agility, and Dexterity) as well as seven ""negative"" (Acrophobia, Claustrophobia, Necrophobia, Superstition, Avarice, Curiosity, and Violent Temper) attributes. In addition, there is a large selection of skills, which include weapon proficiencies and varied abilities such as swimming, dancing, seducing, lying, training animals, knowledge of geography and foreign languages, etc. Characters must eat, drink and sleep regularly during the course of the game, and may also get sick.",369,Realms of Arkania series

"Metal Gear games, self-described as ""tactical espionage action"", are action games with a heavy emphasis on stealth. Most Metal Gear games were designed by Hideo Kojima and developed by Konami. The events depicted in the games usually take place in the near future (a few years later than their respective release dates), though some of the games are set during the Cold War period of the 20th century. The games share an overarching storyline and recurrent characters, most notably the special forces operative with the codename Solid Snake. 

The series made its debut in 1987, with the release of the first Metal Gear, which established its gameplay style and general tone. The gameplay in Metal Gear games encourages stealthy approach; the protagonist must typically avoid attention in order to succeed. However, direct confrontation is not uncommon: during the course of the games, the main character may use firearms, engage opponents in hand-to-hand combat, and face mandatory boss enemies. Many tasks in these games take the shape of mini-game-like activities.

Starting with Metal Gear Solid (1998), the series have become known for extended usage of cinematic cutscenes, conversations, and storylines that touched upon political, ethical, and philosophical problems.

"Castlevania, or Akumajō Dracula (Japanese: 悪魔城ドラキュラ, ""Devil Castle Dracula""), is a series of action games by Konami. The series' setting and plot elements are loosely based on Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, focusing on the titular fictional character. Most of the protagonists in the series (with a few notable exceptions) belong to the Belmont family and are vampire hunters who venture into Dracula's castle with the goal of defeating the powerful vampire following one of his resurrections. The games usually take place in a dark castle and its surroundings, which are populated by horror-themed enemies. 

Classic Castlevania games are 2D platformers in which the protagonist advances through linear stages, defeating regular enemies and bosses. Members of the Belmont family are armed with a whip, which they can also use to destroy parts of the scenery (candle, walls, etc.) to obtain hearts, food and items. Health can be replenished by eating; hearts are used to execute special attacks with equipped items, e.g. throwing axes, daggers, holy crosses, etc.

The first game in the series came in two variants, one of which, Vampire Killer (1986), introduced non-linear exploration elements to the standard action platforming formula. Simon's Quest (1987) expanded upon that idea and added light role-playing elements such as a world map, monetary system, and a day-and-night cycle. 

Of the subsequent installments, Symphony of the Night (1997) took the farthest step on the RPG road, adding experience points and leveling-up to the core gameplay. It also greatly expanded the playing environment, introducing large interconnected stages, some of which could be explored in a non-linear fashion. Some of the series' further incarnations emulated this gameplay concept.

Together with Metroid, later Castlevania installments lead to the concept of a sub-genre dubbed Metroidvania, in which traditional platform elements are combined with heavier character customization and a large game world that the player can explore in a non-linear fashion.

"The Star Fleet games are a series of futuristic turn-based strategy games set in a universe similar to Star Trek, all developed by the same core design team around Trevor C. Sorensen.

The origins of the series go back as far as to the mid-'70s when Trevor Sorensen discovered a StarTrek-type game on the Honeywell mainframe computer of the University of Kansas while attending graduate school there. Playing this game he had many ideas for improvements and additions, but couldn't get in touch with its original authors, thus decided to rewrite it from scratch. Over the next years, until about 1980, he developed a free full-fledged multi-player strategy game called Starfleet that saw great success. At its peak the game was included on a DECUS (DEC Users Group) tape in 1981 and thus achieved worldwide distribution.

Around 1980, however, the code of Starfleet had turned into an unmanageable ""spaghetti"" mess that forced Trevor Sorensen to rewrite it from scratch, again, vastly improving over the old game in the process. This new code base was called Starfleet X and was nearing completion when a new home computer saw its advent that, finally, was powerful enough to host Starfleet X - the IBM PC. In the light of this event, Sorensen decided to commercially release his Starfleet game and founded a partnership company called Cygnus that, after creating a new game universe due to licensing issues, released a dumbed-down version of Starfleet X late in the year 1983. This was the start of the commercial Star Fleet series which further development can be read about in detail here.

In 1998, Brett Keeton contacted Trevor Sorensen with the idea of Star Fleet 1 being ported to Windows, vastly improved in graphics and sound, and sold as shareware. While doing the coding work on this project, the team realized that the 1983 game was too shallow for the modern game market, and thus decided to re-activate the old Starfleet X code and improve upon this code base. Starfleet Deluxe was born. In September 2002, however, the development saw a major drawback when lead programmer Brett Keeton committed suicide at the age of 38, and the rest of the team wasn't able to retrieve the beta version of Starfleet Deluxe from his hard drive.

As of the time of this writing (November 2009) the game stands unfinished, but the latest version can be downloaded and played.",406,Star Fleet series

Trivia

Did you know that…

…Sherlock Holmes is a literary figure, invented by the English author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930), who solved complex criminal cases in 56 short stories and four novels?

…Sherlock Holmes is a scientific detective and most famous for his skills of deduction, deriving happenings from minor clues and details?

...Sherlock Holmes also is the world's first and only consulting detective, meaning that he advises other detectives (private ones as well as Scotland Yard employees) in difficult cases?

…all but two of the Sherlock Holmes stories are written from the perspective of Dr. Watson? Holmes first met his loyal companion in the novel A Study in Scarlet, which is a “Reprint from the Reminiscences of John H. Watson, M.D.”

…Dr. Watson is, of course, a literary invention, too? However, he was modelled after one of Sir Doyle's close friends.

…Holmes resides in 221B Baker Street, London, which is easily the most well-known literary address? Baker Street 221B really exists, and contains a Sherlock Holmes Museum today.

…Holmes’ most famous principle is “When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?”

…Holmes was supposedly interested in a woman named Miss Irene Adler, whom he met in the story A Scandal in Bohemia? There is, however, no evidence that they ever had an affair.

…Sherlock Holmes smokes regularly (he eccentrically stores his tobacco in a Persian slipper) and uses morphine and cocaine occasionally?

…Doyle killed Sherlock Holmes in one story, but was forced to restore him to life after enormous public protest?

…The Hound of Baskerville is a Sherlock Holmes story? You've probably seen the movie. Now go read the novel.

Cancelled Games

There was a third cancelled game in the Nightbreed series and a few cancelled games based on Clive Barker's Hellraiser movie. The only thing we know for sure is that the first was developed for NES by Color Dreams. They also started a print advertisement campaign in 1990. It was supposed to become a kind of super cartridge which would have improved the NES's capabilities greatly. It is rumoured that Wisdom Tree (previously Color Dreams) also developed a Hellraiser PC FPS using the Wolf3D engine.

It is also rumoured that there was a PSX/SNES/PC-98 game based on the franchise by Konami, but if it did exist, it was scrapped in a very early stage during licensing negotiations. On the other hand, it is known that there was a first-person game named Hellraiser: Virtual Hell in development for PC (1995/1996). Supposedly Magnet Interactive Studios cancelled the game because of technical problems with the 3D engine. It seems the game used FMV sequences.

More information about those Hellraiser games can be found here.

"Dragon Quest (earlier installments were known in the West as Dragon Warrior) is a series of Japanese-style role-playing games. It is one of the longest-running, largest, and most influential franchise within this sub-genre; it is also the most popular role-playing series in its homeland. Its first installment (1986) is commonly regarded as one of the most important progenitors of Japanese RPGs.

The franchise was created by Yuji Horii and owes its distinctive audio-visual style to the artist Akira Toriyama and the composer Koichi Sugiyama. Enix is the publisher and the owner of the series' intellectual rights. Various developers have worked on the series, including Chunsoft, Heart Beat, Arte Piazza and Level-5.

Setting

Dragon Quest games are set in traditional medieval fantasy worlds with strong European influences, usually devoid of sci-fi or other stylistic elements popular among Japanese RPGs. The stories of individual installments are normally not directly connected to each other, though they may include common themes, references to common locations, characters, etc.

Story

Dragon Quest games traditionally feature relatively simple plots. In most games, the player controls a ""silent protagonist"" (often a soldier/warrior), whose task is to defeat evil forces that threaten the land. The first six games in the series are often grouped into two trilogies. The Erdrick Trilogy (also known as the Loto Trilogy) includes the first three games, which share common references to the legendary hero Erdrick (Loto in the original Japanese version). The Zenithia Trilogy encompasses the fourth, the fifth, and the sixth installments, all featuring the Zenithian castle in the skies.

Gameplay

The gameplay in Dragon Quest games is also deliberately kept simple throughout the course of the series, compared to Western and even many Japanese RPGs. The series' creator Yuji Horii cited Wizardry and Heart of Phantasm games among the main influences. He stated that he wanted to create role-playing games that were easily accessible to everyone, as opposed to the complex and demanding gameplay systems of Western RPGs. Linear main quests, simple turn-based battles, and a considerable degree of challenge in combat are typical elements of the series' gameplay. However, some installments opted for more complex features, such as job systems, monster-summoning, etc.

There are many recurrent monsters in the series, the most notable one being the slime, which is usually the first monster the player encounters in a Dragon Quest game, and which has become the mascot of the series.

Influence

In Japan, Dragon Quest has become a part of the local culture. The Japanese Diet (the equivalent of a legislative branch of the government) allows no Dragon Quest game to be released on a weekday or Saturday, as too many people used to cut school and work whenever a new Dragon Quest game came out so they could go buy the game instead. Young children also used to be robbed of their copies of any DQ game by junior high and high school students.

To many Japanese people, the English word ""slime"" is associated primarily with the familiar onion-shaped commonplace enemy of the series. The cure spell hoimi also became equivalent to healing in general.

"Games based on the French comic series written by René Goscinny and written and illustrated by Albert Uderzo, featuring the fictional Gaulish warrior Asterix, introduced in 1959 as Astérix le Gaulois (Asterix the Gaul).

The games revolve around the heroic adventures of Asterix and his sidekick Obelix, the menhir delivery man assisted by the valiant Dogmatix, his dog protecting the only Gaulish village (with no name and located in the northwest corner of Gaul) unconquered by Roman conquest under Julius Caesar, with the help of the magic potion brewed by the village druid, Getafix.
In the original French series , this magic potion makes the people who drink it invincible - that what's stated in the first comics anyway, though things are not so clear anymore in Asterix and the Laurel Wreath, where Asterix claims that ""the magic potion makes [them] very strong but not invulnerable"". Truth is: none of the two heroes is ever wounded in any way during the entire series. Obelix is so strong because he fell into the magic potion's brewing pot while he was a little child, which made him permanently invincible. Of course, in the videogame, Asterix and Obelix are not invincible anymore but simply very strong - or else, there wouldn't be much of a challenge.

The character names can either be the original French names or the English translations, though many countries have also adapted separate local translations. The original French names for the main characters are the following:



Astérix (Asterix) - Main hero, Gaulish warrior.

Obélix (Obelix) - Sidekick, Gaulish menhir delivery man.

Panoramix (Getafix) - Gaulish village druid who holds the secret to the 'magic potion' which makes the drinker invincible.

Abraracourcix (Vitalstatistix) - Gaulish village chief.

Bonemine (Impedimenta) - Wife of the village chief.

Assurancetourix (Caconofix) - Gaulish village bard.

Agecanonix (Geriatrix) - Oldest living member of the Gaulish village.

Ordralfabétix (Unhygienix) - Gaulish village fishmonger.

Cétautomatix (Fulliautomatix) - Gaulish village smith.


Many games are based directly on a specific comic or movie. Since the library of Asterix products is pretty big mostly only the basic premise and background story are unique to the reference but incorporate ideas and situations from other Asterix comics or movies. If not stated otherwise all games are side-scrolling platformers.

"A strategy series developed and published by KOEI that is based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel version and uses pingyin romanization for the translation of Chinese names.

Story  

The Three Kingdoms (Chinese: 三国, sanguo) era is a period in Chinese history, following the decline and fall of the Han Dynasty after the Yellow Turban Rebellion. The saga originally existed via oral stories and was eventually made into official history. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms version was later popularized by Chinese writer Luó Guànzhōng between 1330-1400, portraying Liu Bei as the hero of the series and Cao Cao as the antagonist. The game series is heavily influenced by the romantic version rather than the official version.

Depending on the game, a Romance of the Three Kingdoms game may start during the decline of Han dynasty after the Yellow Turban Rebellion (184 AD), followed by periods such as the anti-Dong Zhuo league, the fight for power between the three kingdoms, and ultimately the preliminary establishment of the Jin Dynasty (264 AD). Some series have introduced scenarios and/or characters earlier or later from the usual time frame.

The Three Kingdoms title itself refers to last years of the chaos where a famous scholar in that period prophesied that the warring clans would eventually end with the formation of three remaining kingdoms:



The Kingdom of Wei, initially ruled by Cao Cao.

The Kingdom of Shu, initially ruled by Liu Bei.

The Kingdom of Wu, initially ruled by Sun Jian.


The saga ends during the period where the Kingdom of Wei becomes the victor. However, the Cao clan (Cao Shuang) was overthrown by the Sima clan (Sima Yi) which founded the Jin dynasty (Sima Yan) and eventually united China.

Gameplay  

Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a turn-based strategy game that focuses on:



Top-down political map strategy-type gameplay, where the player control provinces and their natural resources; managing armies and their generals; conducting plots and schemes between the player between or with rival kingdoms. The KOEI-type strategy game familiarizes generals with individual portraits as well as unique character skills and statistics. Individual biographies may also be available partially or completely in the game manual or in game documentation;

Top-down perspective turn-based style combat, where the player position armies led by selected generals against attacking or defending opponents. Romance of the Three Kingdoms III later introduced personal combat (duels) where generals can challenge other generals in hand-to-hand combat, which results may vary from capture to death.

"Suikoden - originally Gensō Suikoden (Japanese: 幻想水滸伝), translated as ""Fantasy Legend of Water Margin"" - is a series of role-playing games by Konami, loosely based on the classic Chinese novel Water Margin. Suikoden is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese Shuihuzhuan (simplified Chinese: 水浒传; traditional Chinese: 水滸傳), meaning ""Legend of Water Margin"".

Setting

All Suikoden games are set during different time periods in the chronology of its fictional fantasy world. The inspiration of the Chinese novel confines itself to the main theme of the series (rebellion against a corrupt government or invading nation), and the concept of 108 heroes. Concrete storylines and characters are unique to the series, and its world has nothing particularly Chinese in it, actually having more in common with medieval Europe.

Individual Suikoden installments are usually not directly connected to each other story-wise, and take place in different regions of the series' vast world. However, many recurrent (usually minor) characters appear in all or most games, and they stories are united by a common historical timeline.

Gameplay

Suikoden series contain many basic elements of Japanese-style RPGs, such as random encounters, simple turn-based battle mechanics, and automatic leveling up of characters. In most Suikoden games, player-controlled party can include up to six active combatants. The series features several common gameplay elements which are present in each installment, and are normally absent from other games of its kind:





Runes: instead of using the more common magic points (MP) system, the characters in Suikoden games equip runes, each containing several levels of magic spells. Depending on the chqaracter's magic level, he/she can cast only a fixed number of each spell before requiring rest to replenish them again. Powerful True Runes can be sometimes acquired and used by some of the characters (usually the protagonist), and often play a prominent role in the story.




Recruiting the 108 Stars of Destiny: one of the main challenges in each Suikoden game is to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny) to the army that confronts the game's antagonists. Many of these characters become eligible for the player-controlled party; others act as support characters of various kinds. Many Stars of Destiny join automatically, as dictated by the plot, but others must be actively sought out, which often requires experimenting with party formation (since some characters would only join if the player brings a specific character to meet them). Recruiting all 108 Stars of Destiny is optional; however, different endings are often unlocked by fulfilling this requirement.




Headquarters Management: in all Suikoden games, player-controlled party will eventually occupy a fortified location (usually a castle), which will serve as headquarters for the army. Recruited characters can be found within the headquarters. Characters who do not actively participate in battles are often able to enhance the headquarters in various ways. These enhancements range from combat-aiding activities (such as a blacksmith relocating to the headquarters and forging the strongest weapons and armor that can be found in the game), to purely aesthetic decorations and mini-games.




Three Kinds of Combat: traditional party-based exploration and battles occupy the largest portion of Suikoden games. However, each game also features two other kinds of combat, strategic army-vs.-army battles and one-on-one duels, which occur sporadically, usually dictated by the plot. The exact mechanics of these special battles vary from game to game.

"Persona is a series of role-playing games, which is a part of Megaten universe. These games distinguish themselves from other Megaten products by having common themes, setting, story-related and gameplay elements of their own.

Setting and Themes

Persona games are set in modern-day Japan, and usually feature high-school students as protagonists. The title refers to powerful mythological beings that can be summoned by the characters in the games to gain unique abilities. Usually, antagonists of demonic origin threaten the peace in a community (a town or a high school), which is overrun by characteristic Megaten demons whom the heroes must stop. The stories of Persona games tend to feature more human characters, and concentrate on aspects of human psychology rather than ideological and religious problems.

Gameplay

The ability to recruit demons into the player-controlled party is absent in Persona games. The party usually consists entirely of human characters, but those can be customized, and their abilities modified, by calling forth a Persona and attaching it to a character. Personae can be obtained by negotiating with encountered enemies, receiving tarot cards, and going to a special facility called the Velvet Room, where Personae can be summoned.",474,Persona series

These Pokémon are the stars of video games for a variety of Nintendo handheld and console systems, as well as a trading card game and animated series. 

Developed by Game Freak, Pokémon games are predominantly RPGs with a heavy emphasis on monster training, somewhat similar in concept to earlier Megami Tensei games. Typically, the protagonist is a monster trainer whose goal is to capture various types of Pokémon and train them so that they can achieve higher level and participate in battles against enemies, which may include hostile trainers and their Pokémon.

This seemingly ordinary, quiet North American town exists in three different dimensions, one being our normal reality, and the other two monster-infested realms that owe their existence to the town's mysterious past. In one of these two dimensions, Silent Hill is a fog-enveloped, nearly abandoned town overrun by supernatural creatures; in the other (called the ""Otherworld""), it is an ever more terrifying place full of dark, hellish imagery. The protagonists are typically ordinary people who venture to the town for personal reasons, and must survive and complete their quests.

Silent Hill started as a survival horror series, featuring traditional gameplay of the genre and emphasizing the protagonists' lack of combat prowess. The main characters had often to rely on improvised melee weapons and weak firearms for defense; escaping and avoiding combat was the preferable option in some instances. Puzzle-solving has also been an essential gameplay element of the series, the puzzles ranging from simple inventory-based tasks to more complex logic- and manipulation-based challenges.",476,Silent Hill series

"This group contains all games prominently featuring the Italian-American plumber Mario, a fictional character created by Shigeru Miyamoto. Mario is one of the most popular video game characters of all time, serving as the mascot of Nintendo and starring in a vast amount of games.

Unofficial fangames can be found in the Mario fangames game group.

Creation

Mario is traditionally depicted as a short man with a mustache, dressed in red overalls with a blue shirt (or the other way around) and a red cap. He first appeared in Donkey Kong (1982) and was originally named Jumpman, owing the name to his ability to jump. Miyamoto intended to name him Mr. Video afterwards, but decided to use Mario after an argument between Nintendo employees and their American warehouse landlord, Mario Segale, concerning overdue rent. Mario was made a plumber because of the sewer-like underground settings of Mario Bros. (1983).

Gameplay

Mario games may belong to different genres, but they gained prominence primarily thanks to its platform installments. Super Mario Bros. (1985) became the most influential Mario game, laying the foundation stone for the side-scrolling platform genre. Ever since that game, Mario's trademark ability has become jumping on enemies' heads to defeat or incapacitate them. He can also consume mushrooms to grow in size, and special flowers to be able to throw fireballs at enemies. In later games Mario acquired other power-ups, including some that allowed him to fly and ride a dinosaur.

Besides platformers, Mario games contain many spin-offs, most notably RPGs, sports, and racing games (see the related groups section).

Other recurrent characters

Mario's brother Luigi has appeared in many Mario games, mostly as a secondary character in two-player modes. One of the series' recurrent storylines involves saving the Princess Toadstool from the clutches of the evil turtle-like creature known as Bowser or King Koopa; his minions, the Koopas, are among the most common enemy characters in Mario games. In Super Mario World (1990), the friendly dinosaur Yoshi made an appearance and has since become a playable character in some of the games. A minor antagonist, a pirate named Wario, appeared in a spin-off series of his own.

Trivia

Cancelled Games



Around 1993, NovaLogic  was developing a Mario platform game titled Super Mario's Wacky Worlds for the Philips CD-i. Due to the Philips CD-i sales declining the game was cancelled. A prototype of the game exists,

Around 1994, a game titled Mario Takes America was in development by Cigam for the Phillips-CD-i. The game's plot involved Mario traveling across America from New York to Hollywood, California where he would star in a film. The game was cancelled due to Phillips cutting off funding for the project and Cigam soon went bankrupt after.

Around 1995,  a game titled VB Mario Land was in development for the Virtual Boy.  A single-level playable demo was shown at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show 1995 in Las Vegas. The game was ultimately cancelled.

In the early 2000s. a game titled Mario Motors for the Nintendo DS was conceived as a Mario Kart spinoff. Only screemshots of this game are known to exist.

Around 2007,, Next Level Games started work on a volleyball game with the title Mario Volleyball. As time went on, the games concept became more combat oriented with the addition of wrestling moves like pile drivers being added so the title was renamed to Super Mario Spikers. The game eventually was never greenlit since the violence was deemed too realistic for a game using the Mario characters.

Although there is a movie series of the same name (beginning in 2004) most of the games in this game group are based on the Dark Horse comic book series. The first two games, Alien Vs. Predator and Alien vs Predator: The Last of His Clan, are side-scrolling action games where the player takes the role of the predator. Better known are the first person shooters Alien Vs Predator for Jaguar and the two Aliens Versus Predator and Aliens Versus Predator 2 for computer systems, all featuring three campaigns for marine, predator and alien. Both games were later enhanced; the first one with an enhanced re-release and the second one with an add-on. The Gold Edition combines main game and add-on.

The console game Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction however goes into another direction and is a real-time strategy game. The third-person shooter based on the second movie picture Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem has, like the first games in the series, just one campaign where the player controls the Predator.

"Breath of Fire is a series of Japanese-style role-playing games by Capcom. The first Breath of Fire (1993) was also the first RPG made by this company. 

Themes

The games in the series are not directly connected to each other plot-wise, and don't have any chronological continuity. However, in each Breath of Fire game, the two main characters are invariably called Ryu (Japanese for ""dragon"") and Nina. These characters may have different personalities and their common story is different each time, though Ryu always possesses the ability to transform into a dragon, and Nina is always a young girl with wings. Breath of Fire games are usually set in medieval fantasy worlds with technological elements. Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter (2002) is set in a dark ""steampunk"" environment.

Gameplay

Most of the games in the series follow the traditional Japanese RPG formula, including simple turn-based combat, automatic leveling up, random enemy encounters, etc. A recurrent gameplay element in all of the games are Ryu's dragon transformation abilities. The exact mechanics of these transformations vary from game to game. Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter differs from the rest of the series also in the gameplay aspect: the game features tactical combat and emphasizes survival elements.

"Fallout is a franchise composed of predominantly role-playing games. They are set in a post-apocalyptic world, and share setting-related and gameplay similarities with Wasteland, which is considered the spiritual predecessor of the series. 

Setting

The games are set in the United States of America of the 22nd and 23rd century, in an alternate timeline that followed rapid development of weapon techniques and atomic physics after World War II, which resulted in a technological progress quite different from the one that took place in reality. A series of events dubbed ""Resource Wars"" eventually led to the Great War of 2077, a nuclear disaster that annihilated most of the Earth's civilization and population in just two hours.

The post-apocalyptic world of Fallout is marked by the co-existence of advanced technology (robots, energy weapons, etc.) with a ""retro"" atmosphere and aesthetics reminiscent of the 1950's in the USA, including household items such as old radio transistors, typewriters, and TV sets; rough capitalism, flourishing criminal organizations, Cold War paranoia, etc. A characteristic element of the setting are Vaults, large underground dwellings built by the government as protective measures against atomic war. Historical cities are mostly abandoned, and large parts of the wasteland is radioactive.

Several factions fight for dominance in this world. Among those is the Brotherhood of Steel, remnants of the US army, a quasi-religious organization that aims to preserve pre-war technology. The Enclave, composed of ex-government members, sometimes plays the role of antagonists in Fallout games, their goal being a total annihilation of mutated creatures. Among the latter, the Super Mutants are the most prominent ones, and are often hostile to humans. The North California Republic (NCR) is the largest and best-organized faction, resembling a pre-war state.

Gameplay

Main Fallout games are distinguished by their emphasis on flexible role-playing. The games utilize a character development system known as S.P.E.C.I.A.L. (acronym of the main character attributes Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) and a skill system based on that of Wasteland, which includes combat-related abilities (proficiency in melee or guns, healing, repair, etc.) as well as skills which are used to handled the situations in the game. Among those are speech, barter, science, lockpick, steal, and others. Many problems in Fallout games can be solved in different ways, often in a non-confrontational fashion, depending on the character development path chosen by the player. This is particularly noticeable in the first two games, both of which can be completed without actively engaging in a single combat encounter.

Early Fallout games had tactical turn-based combat, but later installments inclined more towards action gameplay reminiscent of first-person shooters. Fallout 3 (2008) was the first game in the series done with a fully 3D engine; it introduced the option of switching between FPS-like action combat and a system dubbed V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System), which incorporated elements of the classic turn-based battles, including usage of action points for movement and attack, and targeting of specific body parts.

Development history

The series were originally created by an Interplay division that became Black Isle Studios, starting with the release of Fallout (1997). After the first sequel was produced in a rapid fashion, Interplay changed focus to make two spin-offs, Fallout Tactics (a Fallout themed squad tactical combat game) and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel (a console action game). A second sequel to the original Fallout (now known by its codename: Van Buren) was canceled in 2003 when Interplay shut down Black Isle due to financial difficulties.

After securing the rights to develop Fallout 3 in 2004, Bethesda Softworks acquired the entire Fallout license in August 2007 for $5.75 million from Interplay. In the same deal, Interplay was granted the right to produce a Fallout MMO. In April 2009, the company issued a SEC filing seeking to end its contract with Interplay over the MMO's absence.

Trivia

In September 2009, Bethesda sued Interplay over the latter distributing Fallout Trilogy, packaging Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics. According to Bethesda, permission should have been sought on the trilogy's packaging, advertising and promotional material prior to its release, and customers have become confused between it and Bethesda's more recent Fallout 3.

""Interplay's signing of licensing agreements with digital distribution sites such as Steam has further breached the trademark agreement signed, the legal filing continues, an action which has caused Bethesda 'immediate, substantial and irreparable harm.'"", claims the company. Bethesda asked the court to terminate the licensing agreement between the two companies which would allow Interplay to licence back rights to the Fallout property in order to develop the Fallout MMO. 

In December 2009, a US District Court Judge judged in favor of Interplay, meaning that Interplay is still free to publish the original three PC titles (Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics) and the Fallout Trilogy compilation. Interplay is also be free to continue work on its massively multiplayer online version of the franchise, currently known as Project V13.

It is part of the Maxis Sim series by Maxis Software (since 1997 a division of Electronic Arts), which was especially known in the 1990s because of the SimCity city construction and management games, of which the first game was released in 1989. Because of the success of the series, The Sims Studio became one of EA's main four franchise labels in 2007 before being abandoned in favor of returning to Maxis' branding. In February 2010, ten years after the first game, EA announced that it made a total profit of 2.5 billion through the series and sold more than 125 million copies of different instalments over multiple platforms.

The creative mastermind behind the concept is Will Wright, who was also behind the original SimCity game. Wright was inspired by a fire in 1991 that destroyed his house and all his possessions. He had to build up his life from scratch again, layer by layer, and this gave him the idea of a life simulation game. Since early 2009, Wright is no longer involved with EA or the series as a whole, after quitting the company.

"Sonic the Hedgehog is a series of games released by Sega and originally developed by its Sonic Team division. The titular character, a semi-anthropomorphic hedgehog who can run at supersonic speed, was created to fill the role of Sega's official mascot (replacing Alex Kidd) and a character who was supposed to compete in popularity with Nintendo's Mario. In most games Sonic is the main protagonist, and his quest usually involves stopping the evil genius Dr. Ivo ""Eggman"" Robotnik from conquering the world.

Most of the games in the series, starting with the first Sonic the Hedgehog (1991), are fast-paced platformers, though spin-offs may belong to other genres as well. Speed is the defining feature of Sonic games, with the protagonist rushing through stages and being catapulted forward by springs, loops, and other devices. Sonic also collects rings that protect him from damage or grant other bonuses. Collecting special Chaos Emeralds is a recurrent plot device which has also been used for gameplay purposes (such as bonus stages).",584,Sonic the Hedgehog universe

"A long-running series revolving around the adventures of the Star Fox Team as they try to defend their home planet, Corneria, and the rest of the Lylat System, usually from the evil emperor, Andross, although recent titles in the series have deviated from this.  Throughout the series, players have always taken control of Fox McCloud, the leader of the Star Fox team, in the single-player mode.

With the original game developed in a collaboration between Nintendo and Argonaut, Star Fox is, for the most part, a 3rd person rail-shooter, although many incarnations of the series have featured ""all range mode,"" where the game allows you the freedom to navigate in a box of 3D space.  

The first two games in the series that were released, Star Fox and Star Fox 64, introduced ground-breaking new technology and concepts to the video game industry.  Star Fox for the Super Famicom/SNES introduced the Super FX chip and featured polygonal graphics.  Star Fox 64 introduced the ""Rumble Pak,"" a peripheral for the Nintendo 64 that provided force feedback depending on what was happening onscreen.  After the fifth generation of consoles, rumble became a standard in videogame controllers.

Star Fox has made its portable debut in the form of Star Fox Command for the Nintendo DS.  The game is not only the Star Fox series' first handheld appearance, but it is also the first iteration of the series to allow for online competitive play.  After the series got off track and began focusing on ground combat and exploration in Star Fox Adventures and Star Fox Assault, Star Fox Command promises to return the series to its roots with purely Arwing combat.

Cancelled Games



Around 1995,  a StarFox game was seemingly in development for the Virtual Boy.  A tech demo was shown at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show 1995 in Las Vegas. The game was ultimately cancelled.

"Legend of Zelda (often referred to as simply Zelda) is a series of games by Nintendo that traditionally combine action-based gameplay with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. The games are set in a magical, medieval fantasy-like land of Hyrule, and for the most part feature at least three recurrent characters: the protagonist, a young boy named Link; the titular princess Zelda, whose rescue is usually the goal of the game; and the antagonist, an evil magician known as Ganon or Ganondorf. 

The first game in the series, The Legend of Zelda (1986), was notable for adding extensive exploration and problem-solving in a vast game world to the action genre. The game was instrumental in paving the path for the birth of the so-called ""action-adventures"", and also influenced the development of action role-playing games. Further installments followed and expanded upon its formula. Early games usually had a top-down perspective (with the notable exception of the side-scrolling The Adventure of Link (1987), which also was the only game with true RPG elements in the series); later, Ocarina of Time (1998) made a shift to 3D for the series.

Zelda games are known for their character management, which lends a RPG-like flavor to the games. Link can equip weapons and armor, buy and sell items, visit towns, and talk to non-player characters. Link's abilities can be enhanced, and attributes raised; this is done by finding specific items that affect these attributes or by advancing the plot rather than by gathering experience points and leveling up. 

Dungeons in Zelda games commonly contain various traps that the player has to overcome by using Link's items and abilities, in a light puzzle-solving fashion. The games often contain many secrets and optional areas, which may bestow benefits upon the protagonist but are not required to discover in order to complete the game.

"Metroid is a series of sci-fi action games starring the bounty hunter Samus Aran, who works for the Galactic Federation. Her missions mostly involve protecting the galaxy from the Space Pirates (usually led by the recurrent antagonist Mother Brain), who try to harvest the powers of alien creatures (such as the titular Metroids) for their evil purposes. In order to stop them, Samus has to travel to and explore various hostile planets. 

The first game in the series, Metroid (1986), defined its gameplay concept and most of the features. Metroid games typically combine platforming (as in Mario games) with free exploration, taking a cue from Zelda. As opposed to other platform games of its time, the player is not required to proceed through a series of linear stages in one direction, but rather explores large and complex interconnected areas. In Metroid Prime (2002) the series switched from 2D platforming to a first-person shooter format.

Clad in her cybernetic space suit, Samus can acquire various powers, which are scattered around the game world. Often it is required to obtain certain abilities in order to unlock new areas, return to explored locations with new abilities to enter previously inaccessible parts, and discover secret areas. Some of the recurrent powers are a Morph Ball, which allows Samus to roll through tight spaces; missiles, which open special doors and cause more damage to boss enemies; energy tanks, which increase her overall health; and others.

Metroid games usually have a somewhat dark setting, and are notable for their almost complete lack of dialogue and other characters except Samus herself, attempting to create a solitary, foreboding atmosphere. Together with Castlevania, Metroid series lead to the concept of a sub-genre dubbed Metroidvania, in which traditional platform elements are combined with heavier character customization and a large game world that the player can explore in a non-linear fashion.

A Nintendo-owned franchise, games in this group have only been released for Nintendo consoles.

This is the order of the games chronologically in the Metroid universe:



Metroid/Metroid: Zero Mission

Metroid Prime: Hunters

Metroid Prime 2: Echoes

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption

Metroid II: Return of Samus/Metroid: Samus Returns

Cameo

Samus Aran made a regular appearance in the Valiant comic series Captain N: The Game Master, replacing the TV show's regular character line-up of Mega Man and Simon Belmont. Samus would often compete with Princess Lana for Kevin's affections. The comic series was different as it used only Nintendo licensed characters, and not the 3rd party heroes.

There were a number of cancelled successors to the franchise:



Turrican 3D was developed by Manfred Trenz for THQ. It was planned to be released in December 1999 for PC and Dreamcast.

At the same time, Factor 5 worked at the unofficial (because of missing name rights) successor Thomado for GameCube with a a science-fiction Western scenario. It was cancelled because Nintendo wanted them to concentrate on Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II - Rogue Leader. There exists a one-level demo for Nintendo 64, where development originally started.

After they received the Turrican rights back, Factor 5 developed 3D-Turrican for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was cancelled in 2007 because they could not find a publisher.

Protovision developed the unofficial Turrican 3 for Commodore 64, but development stopped in 1998 on request of Factor 5. They did re-brand it to T3 which was ultimately cancelled after a re-release demo was stolen and cracked during a scene party. The preview can be found as bonus material in Hockey Mania.

"This group lists Game &amp; Watch games that have been ported to later Nintendo handheld systems, be it as a standalone game or as part of a compilation.

The Game &amp; Watch series was a line of standalone handheld LCD games based on a design by Gunpei Yokoi, produced by Nintendo from 1980 to 1991. Each device functioned as a single arcade-style game, and also as a pocket watch or alarm clock. Generally, these games provided two difficulty settings and ended when the player was defeated three times, though there were exceptions to this rule such as Zelda.

It was these devices that saw the first use of the four-way D-pad, which has since become a staple in video game control schemes, as well as Nintendo's first foray into multi-screen games. The monochrome nature of the LCD games have found iconic status among early Nintendo games, with the image of a silhouette man becoming a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Melee and it's successor.

"Phantasy Star games, created by Sega, include the original Japanese-style role-playing series (which encompassed four games), its various spin-offs (such as the Phantasy Star Text Adventures series), and online RPGs, which originated with Phantasy Star Online (2000) and have been dominating the series ever since. The initial games were designed by Rieko Kodama and Yuji Naka.

All Phantasy Star games take place in the same fictional universe, which is somewhat similar to that of Star Wars, incorporating space travel, alien races, elements of medieval fantasy, and the overarching ""good vs. evil"" plot that involves the ultimate antagonist, the Dark Force. The original tetralogy is set on the Algol Solar System, which consists of four planets: the technologically advanced Palma, the originally desert-covered Motavia, the icy Dezolis, and the mysterious Rykros, which is visible only once every thousand years. The four games also feature common chronology and recurrent characters. The online games took the action to other solar systems within the same universe. 

The first Phantasy Star (1987) is widely regarded as one of the progenitors of Japanese-style role-playing games, influencing the subsequent development of the genre with its distinct anime style, stylistic variety in the setting, and emphasis on character-driven narrative. Notable gameplay elements of Phantasy Star included two navigation perspectives (top-down for towns and world map, first-person for dungeons, similarly to Ultima), integration of both medieval (swords) and futuristic (laser guns) weapons, and usage of TP (technique points) for ""techniques"" which replaced magic spells.

Phantasy Star II (1989) contained most of the original's gameplay elements, while replacing first-person dungeons with top-down ones; their maze-like nature, however, was preserved, and even increased. Phantasy Star III (1990) differs from other installments due to its predominantly medieval fantasy setting. Phantasy Star IV (1993) concluded the tetralogy; after its release, the series has entered seven-year hiatus, ending with the release of Phantasy Star Online, which took the series into a new direction.

"Shogun: Total War is a series of strategy games set in the Sengoku Jihai (Sengoku period) of Japan and was originally developed the Creative Assembly Ltd. The player controls one of the many warlord families during that period and aims to conquer Japan through military might, diplomacy, and subterfuge. Features may also include western influences of the Dutch, the Portuguese, Christianity, and the introduction of gunpowder units.

The series, as with other Total War games may share the following features:
* Political Map  

The political map is a top-down perspective of the whole or partial map of Japan, viewing all factions involved as well as figurines symbolizing samurai generals and troop units. All non-combative strategy actions occurs in this area, which includes troop and resource management, troop movement, diplomacy, and subterfuge using emissaries or ninja.



Warfare  


Total War introduced one of the first realistic semi real-time 3D medieval army battles in third person perspective, consisting of troop formation, troop fatigue, shock troops, geographical cover, and most prominent of all, battlefield morale. The player may pause battle at any time (inapplicable during multiplayer) to manage troops or do it while in real time.

Unlike many strategy games, the purpose in battle is not to achieve complete victory by totally annihilating all enemy forces. Rather, it is to force the enemy to retreat or flee from the battlefield. This is done by (a) killing the enemy general or (b) killing a lot of enemy units (from the rear or the flank). Accomplishing this will severely effect the morale of an army which in return may provoke a mass retreat, allowing opposing units to freely decimate enemies fleeing from the battlefield.

"Total War is a series of hybrid turn-based strategy/real-time tactics war games developed by The Creative Assembly, focusing on strategies of historical warfare such as battle formations, shock troops, moral degradation, army fatigue and siege strategies. Up to this point, the themes introduced are either historical war strategies or fictional (specifically, Warhammer-licensed).

Gameplay in this series (up to this point) is identifiable by certain distinctions:



a diagonal-down perspective turn-based political map; where the player develops structural buildings on controlled provinces to increase revenue, equip and recruit armies;

a diagonal-down (camera rotatable) perspective specifically for real-time battle sessions.

"Gothic is a series of role-playing games with action combat, originally created by the German developer Piranha Bytes. The games are set in an unnamed medieval fantasy world, in or around the fictional kingdom of Myrtana.

Story

The first three Gothic games are united by an overarching storyline. The nameless male hero is initially deported by Rhobar, king of Myrtana, to a prison colony separated from the rest of the world by a magic barrier. The first Gothic (2001) describes the hero's struggle in the colony, which ends in his escape. In Gothic II (2002), the hero travels to the island of Khorinis, trying to avert the advent of a fearsome dragon, and getting involved in a war between humans and orcs. Finally, in Gothic 3 (2006), aided by his friends, the hero reaches Myrtana and neighboring countries, where he must find a way to stop the war and discover the plans of the manipulative magician Xardas, who had been his instructor in the first two games.

Gameplay

Gothic games are set in vast 3D environments, which can usually be freely explored. The protagonist is able to jump, climb, swim, and dive. Combat is action-oriented. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies and completing main and secondary quests. Leveling up grants the player a number of ability points. However, the player must also find NPCs who would train the hero in various categories; the player can then decide into which ability he/she wishes to channel the gained experience. The protagonist can specialize in close combat, ranged weapons, and magic. Choosing one path does not exclude the others; theoretically, the hero can be trained fully and acquire all the skills in all three categories.

Conversations with NPCs and sub-quests play a significant role. Typically, the player must perform quests to gain the trust of NPCs and raise the hero's social rank. The player can (and often should) join some of the factions present in the games. Usually, joining a faction alters some of the subsequent quests, and might also influence the events of the storyline.

Trivia

After developing three main games in the series, publisher JoWooD announced in June 2007 that they will continue development of the series with another studio. JoWooD now owns the rights to the name Gothic and the franchise, which was officially confirmed on June 6, 2007.

The official fourth game in the Gothic series, developed by Spellbound, is called Arcania: Gothic 4, and features noticeable gameplay changes compared to the previous games in the series. However, original developer Piranha Bytes has teamed up with publisher Deep Silver to release Risen, which looks and plays similarly to a Gothic game and can be considered a spiritual successor of the series, despite the fact that the developers were forced to invent a new world and new characters after losing the copyright.

Trivia

Perspective

Contrary to popular belief, the graphical perspective of SimCity 4 is actually trimetric rather than isometric, meaning none of the three visible sides of an object are equally viewable. SimCity 2000 and SimCity 3000 had dimetric perspectives, meaning the sides are equally visible, but the top is less visible. There has never been an isometric SimCity.

"Capcom's Devil May Cry series features the half human / half demon protagonist Dante who works as a Devil Hunter. Dante's family consists of his demon father Sparda, his human mother Eva, and his brother Vergil. Other major characters in the series include Trish, Lady, and the main villain Mundus.

While Dante was the main protagonist of the first three games (along with Lucia in Devil May Cry 2) in the series, he shared the spotlight with Nero in Devil May Cry 4.

The games in the Devil May Cry series are third-person hack-and-slash action games. Gameplay typically emphasizes stylish combat giving the player a grade during the fighting. Dante is usually equipped with his two guns named Ebony &amp; Ivory and his sword Rebellion, although in the games he usually gets access to more swords and firearms. These weapons can usually be increased in effectiveness by purchasing upgrades by spending demon's souls that were collected from defeated enemies.

The Devil May Cry series received a reboot when the game DmC: Devil May Cry was released. This title is a reimagining of the series, with the same protagonist Dante, but set in an alternate universe. This reboot was made with the intent to appeal to a more western audience.

"Ys (イース) is a series of predominantly action role-playing games by Nihon Falcom. Its first installment, The Vanished Omens (1987), was among the earliest top-down action RPGs. It is currently the largest and longest-running Japanese series in the genre. 

Ys games takes place in a medieval fantasy world called Eresia, which has certain similarities to Europe. The title itself is derived from a mythical city in Brittany, France, which was swallowed by ocean. In the game series, Ys is the name of a floating island, home to a mysterious ancient civilization, around which the plot of early installments revolves. The series features a recurrent protagonist, the red-haired swordsman and adventurer Adol Christin. 

In Ys games the player usually controls a single protagonist, who gains experience points and levels up by defeating enemies. The distinguishing gameplay mechanic of the series is its action-based combat coupled with top-down exploration similar to those found in turn-based RPGs. A gameplay feature that was particularly common in early installments is ""bumping"" combat, which allowed action-based battles without the necessity to press a separate action key or button. This, along with recharging health, became a staple gameplay element of the series and led to the term ""Ys-like"" when describing comparable games.

"This group includes Xenogears and Xenosaga games. These are Japanese-style role-playing games (RPGs), notable for their complex storylines, giant robot combat, and usage of symbolic references to teachings and myths of Judaism and Christianity.

Xenogears (1998) was released as a stand-alone game by Square. Its lead designer Tetsuya Takahashi left the company, and founded Monolith Software, Inc.. The new company began working on the Xenosaga project. In 2003, Namco published the first episode of the planned six. However, the last three episodes were never released, and the story was wrapped up in the third installment.

Xenosaga games are directly connected to each other story-wise; basically, it is one long story divided into three parts. The plot connection with Xenogears is less obvious, but many common themes and a few characters that bear strong resemblance to each other indicate that Xenosaga games are prequels to Xenogears.

In all these games, characters are able to pilot giant mechs (called ""gears""), and use them in battles. The exact battle mechanics, with gears or otherwise, vary from game to game.",1584,Xenogears / Xenosaga universe

"Megaten (abbreviation of Megami Tensei, 女神転生, meaning ""Goddess Reincarnation"") encompasses all games that feature themes, characters, and gameplay elements first introduced in  Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei. With a few exceptions, these games belong to the role-playing genre. This includes games under the Shin Megami Tensei label, sub-series such as  Persona, and others. It is commonly considered the third major Japanese role-playing series (together with Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy).

Atlus' flagship series, Megaten includes games and sub-series that were created by many different designers; the most notable of them are perhaps Kouji ""Cozy"" Okada and Kazuma Kaneko. Though the first Megaten game was based on a series of horror novels by Aya Nishitani, subsequent installments developed fully independent storylines, usually not connected to each other and even set in different time periods. The dominant setting of the series, however, remains Japan in present day or near future, often with post-apocalyptic elements.

Themes

Games that belong to Megaten universe are distinguished by their preference for dark, ""gothic"" themes, almost total absence of characteristic Japanese ""cute"" elements, and the abundance of supernatural characters taken from various mythological systems of the world, collectively referred to as ""demons"". Beside the purely mythological creatures, these games often feature prominent figures from widespread religious systems as characters, including for example Vishnu, Vairocana, Lucifer, and even God of Judaism and Christianity. The protagonists of Megaten are usually young people (often high-school students), who acquire particular skills that allow them to communicate with demons and defeat the antagonists with their help.

Gameplay

Traditionally, Megaten games are heavy on ""dungeon crawling"". Much of the gameplay in these games is dedicated to exploring complex, maze-like environments, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. One of the series' trademark gameplay elements (not present in all the games) is the ability to contact regular enemies (through direct talking or other means) - and either recruit them as playable party members, or make them serve the player-controlled party in other ways.",1705,Megami Tensei / Megaten universe
"Shin Megami Tensei is the main series of role-playing games within the  Megami Tensei (Megaten) universe, The series started its existence with the seminal RPG of the same name, originally released for Super Famicom (SNES). Sequels and spin-offs soon followed.

Limitations: For the sake of clarity, sub-series of Megaten (such as  Persona,  Devil Summoner, etc.) should not be included in this group. Only stand-alone titles with the Shin Megami Tensei brand and strong similarities in gameplay, setting, and design, can be accepted as part of the group.",1709,Shin Megami Tensei series
"Devil Summoner is a sub-series within the Megaten universe. The first installment, Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner (1995), as well as its sequel Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers (1998) were close to the main Shin Megami Tensei series gameplay-wise, retaining and enhancing its demon communication, recruiting, and fusion system, and introducing the ""loyalty system"", which required the player to raise the loyalty level of recruited demons to make them more obedient during battles. The Law and Chaos alignments of Shin Megami Tensei, however, played a lesser role in these games; the stories also eschewed apocalyptic and religious overtones.

With Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner - Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army (2006), the series entered a new phase. The setting has been changed to the Taishō era (1920's) in Japan, and the story revolved around the investigations conducted by the detective and devil summoner Raidou Kuzunoha. The gameplay underwent the biggest change, abandoning the traditional turn-based combat and conversations in favor of action-oriented battles, in which the player controlled only Raidou and one of the recruited demons.",1713,Devil Summoner series
"Tales is a series of Japanese role-playing games originally developed by Wolf Team and published by Namco. The games in the series are, with a few exceptions, completely unrelated to each other story-wise. They are usually set in traditional medieval fantasy-themed environments and have anime-style visuals.

Formally, Tales games are traditional Japanese-style RPGs, with character-driven storylines, fairly linear progression, third-person exploration of towns and hostile areas, simple leveling up system, etc. Characters usually belong to defined classes and learn their own unique abilities as they level up. Special attacks require TP (Technical Points).

However, combat system in these games differs significantly from conventional turn-based mechanics. The games use a so-called LMBS (Linear Motion Battle System) combat style, which resembles that of fighting games. Enemy encounters take place on separate, usually side-scrolling, screens. Combat is action-based; the player has direct control over one of the characters, navigating him or her on the battle screen and attacking enemies with various fighting combos or special techniques. Companions are controlled by the AI, but the player has the option of pausing the battle and issuing orders to them.",1717,Tales series
"Star Ocean is a series of predominantly sci-fi-themed (with medieval fantasy elements) Japanese role-playing games developed by tri-Ace. The games are set in the same universe but are usually not directly related to each other story-wise and feature different casts of playable characters. 

Although structurally they are traditional Japanese-style RPGs with largely linear progression and simple character-building mechanics, Star Ocean games feature action-based combat similar to that of Tales games. Some of the designers of Tales of Phantasia also worked on the first Star Ocean (1996), which was considered its spiritual follower. 

Besides the action-oriented battles, Star Ocean games are distinguished by their item creation system (through alchemy, metalworking, cooking, and other means); the most powerful items in the games are usually those created by the player. Another notable recurrent gameplay element are the so-called ""private actions"". By choosing different dialogue responses, the player makes the protagonist interact with his or her companions, influencing their relationships (as friends or romantically) and ultimately branching the storyline and affecting the ending.

The setting of the game is a fantasy post-apocalyptic world, which was once dominated by a powerful and technologically advanced race known as the Ancients. Thousand years ago, the Ancients created monsters they used in wars, but the ensuing cataclysms have brought their downfall, ruining their civilization and reducing their population to a few survivors. However, some of their monsters have survived, continuing to threaten the existence of the world. A faction known as The Empire has found a way to harvest some of the technology used by the Ancients, which it uses primarily for military purposes.

A distinct feature of the series is the usage of a fictional language (commonly named ""Panzerese"") in the cutscenes of the game.

"Games drawing on the most successful British comic book character, John Wagner's ""Judge Dredd"", and the environs and denizens of his Mega-City One stomping grounds, as originally published in the 2000 AD comic book series and loosely adapted in a big-budget 1995 movie.

Character history  

Judge Joe Dredd and his outlandish neo-fascist world came to life on march 5, 1977 on the pages of the 2000 A.D. magazine (A.D. as in ""After Disaster""). The creators, John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra, drew upon the dawn of the Thatcher era (the world-famous conservative prime minister of Britain from the late 70's to the early 80's) and the growing Punk movement among Britain's youth and extrapolated both elements to the ridiculous yet ominous levels seen in their comic, in which a bloated, irrational futuristic state suppresses all human rights and freedoms in its quest for total order and security. The most recognizable face of this system are its ""judges"", enforcers with instant on-field judiciary powers which get to decide if you go to jail five months for jaywalking or get instant execution via a bullet in the head.

Eventually growing out of 2000 A.D.'s cult fandom, Dredd took on its own series and by mid 80's became the most famous European comic book along such classics as Barbarella, thanks to its unique art and darkly humorous take on such issues as legal liberties or human rights, spawning subsequent spin-off series which included toned-down DC Comics versions and crossovers. The character's popularity eventually led him to guest star in various heavy metal albums, radio serials and by 1995 its own movie starring Sylvester Stallone. The movie spawned its own videogame/comic adaptations and surfaced momentarily in a small comic series or an offshoot product.

One of the most interesting notes about Dredd however (and one that few licensed cash-ins managed to take on) is the fact that while he's the hero of the comics he's not the typical wildcard/rebel-in-the-system you might expect had for instance the comics been created in the U.S. Nope, instead Dredd is an active supporter of the fascist, totalitarian state he works for!

"This group includes games set in the time period in Chinese history between ca. 168 A.D and 280 A.D., known as the Three Kingdoms era (simplified Chinese: 三国). It began after the decline and fall of the Han Dynasty after the Yellow Turban Rebellion, and ended with the destruction of the Wei kingdom which later became the Jin Dynasty. The three kingdoms refer to Shu (in today's Sichuan province), initially ruled by Liu Bei and later led by the renowned strategist Zhuge Liang; Wei (Northern China), ruled by Cao Cao and his sons; and Wu (South-East China), ruled by the Sun family.

The historical events of the era were later depicted in the novel Sanguo Yanyi (三国演义, Romance of the Three Kingdoms) by the 14th century Chinese writer Luo Guanzhong (simplified Chinese: 罗贯中). Many subsequent works of fiction (including video games) followed the characteristics given to the historical figures of the Three Kingdoms era in the novel. For example, they tended to portray Liu Bei and other leaders of the Shu kingdom as the positive heroes, while Cao Cao was regarded as the main antagonist.

In South East Asia, the translation Samkok of the Hokkian dialect is more commonly known for Three Kingdoms.

"Wonder Boy is a series of predominantly platform games developed by Westone. Most of the games in the series feature a recurrent protagonist, the titular boy with a caveman-like appearance known as Tom-Tom. The plots often involve his girlfriend Tanya being kidnapped, and rescuing her becomes the main goal of the game.

While the first Wonder Boy (1986) was a fairly straightforward side-scrolling game, its sequel Wonder Boy in Monster Land (1987) defined most of the series' characteristic gameplay elements, focusing on expansive platforming with light role-playing elements such as a monetary system, weapon and equipment management, and occasional conversations with NPCs. It also shifted the game's setting from tropical environments to medieval fantasy.

As per their agreement with Sega, Westone retained the rights to their games but not to the trademark characters. As a result, various ports by Hudson Soft were released under different titles and also changed the names of the characters. Eventually some of these ports, dubbed Adventure Island, led to development of new independent titles in their own series.

"This group includes games based on the Japanese manga and anime Fist of the North Star (北斗の拳, Hokuto no Ken). The original manga, serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump between 1983 and 1988, was written by Buronson and drawn by Tetsuo Hara. It tells the story of Kenshiro, master of the Hokuto Shinken martial art, who along with a small fraction of the world population has survived a devastating nuclear war in the year of 199X. The civilization on Earth descends into a desert world filled to the brink with scum and villainy where the strong have the word of power, and the weak are just cattle awaiting to be slaughtered. As a lone bastion of justice, Kenshiro roams this Mad Max-like wasteland and puts evil back into its place.

Since materials have become scarce after the war, the fists and the legs are the new weapons of choice. In particular, Hokuto Shinken allows Kenshiro to use the pressure points of the human body in order to heal or to blow up the guts out of his enemies. Despite being aimed at Japanese teens, Fist of the North Star is bloodier and much more violent than most Jump titles serialized in the last 20 years. It spawned several manga side stories focused on Kenshiro's archnemeses and friends, and was adapted into two main anime series, several movies and OVAs.

The most well-known games based on the series are action games in one form or another, including the second game released on the NES and the SEGA Master System title retooled into Black Belt for the Western release. Both were platform beat-'em-ups. More recently Tecmo Koei released the Ken's Rage games, using the basic mechanics of their long-lasting Dynasty Warriors series. Less known are Hokuto no Ken 3, 4, and 5, all of them RPGs.

"Metal Max is a series of role-playing games initially created by Hiroshi Miyaoka and his company Crea-Tech Inc. Despite its Japanese origins, the series has been known for abandoning the genre's traditional, restricted plot-driven game progression mechanics, opting instead for free-roaming, non-linear gameplay.

The games in the series are set in a post-apocalyptic world with slight humorous overtones. Following an event known as the Great Destruction, large quantities of rogue mechanical mutations have begun to infest the world. Hunting these ""outlaws"" and scavenging mechanical parts for vehicle-building has become a common (if dangerous) profession. The protagonist of the games is usually one of such hunters, and his companions may include mechanics, soldiers, and (in later games) dogs that can equip mounted guns. There is little emphasis on the story in those games, as they mostly deal with outlaw-defeating quests; however, unique characters do appear and a main plot can be completed provided certain events have been triggered.

The gameplay involves standard world map navigation and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. However, unlike the vast majority of Japanese RPGs, the player is free to roam the world and visit any town or dungeon from the onset, with only the difficulty of the battles serving as possible barriers (though in some of the games it is possible to run away from any battle). Characters can fight on foot or in armored vehicles (mostly tanks). These vehicles can be customized by outfitting them with chassis, main and sub-weapons, etc., as well as repaired and upgraded.",2480,Metal Max series

In Japan, the preferred term is Eroge (エロゲ, short for ""erotic game""). Bishōjo (美少女, ""pretty girl""; also referred to as Gal Game) is a rather vague designation, often used to describe any game in which the player character interacts with attractive anime-style girls, regardless of the adult content. The matter is further complicated by the fact that some hentai games (e.g. GunBlaze, Eve Burst Error, and others) were re-released (usually on a console system) with all explicit content removed. 

Night Life (1982) was the first commercially released eroge. The majority of hentai games are Japanese-style adventures or visual novels with minimal interaction, often also containing vast amounts of dialogue and a developed narrative. These games may include simulation elements, often revolving around dating; pure sex simulation games are also not uncommon. However, there are also many eroge that belong to other genres, such as role-playing, fighting, strategy, and others.

Limitations:  





Only games with explicit nudity in context of a sexual situation may be included in this group. If at least one version of the game answers the above requirements, it may be included, even if its adult content was removed from other versions. A game with heavy ""bishōjo"" characteristic (anime style, dating, romance, implicit sex, etc.) may be included only if it also contains aforementioned properties. To illustrate: Yu-No can be part of the group; Tokimeki Memorial games can not.




Due to the nature of Japanese games, it is sometimes hard to determine what qualifies as explicit nudity and what doesn't. For the sake of clarity, games with rare and occasional glimpses of nudity do not qualify for inclusion in this group. For example, Cosmic Fantasy 4 Chapter 1 should not be classified as a hentai game.




Manga and anime aesthetics are commonly associated with eroge; however, they are not a requirement. Some very early Japanese adult games, as well as many 3D ones, tend to have a lesser focus on anime aesthetics; rare cases such as Ayumi-chan Monogatari: Jisshaban even eschew them completely. The terms ""eroge"" and ""hentai"" traditionally only refer to Japanese games; therefore, any Japanese-made adult game qualifies for this group. Non-Japanese adult games, on the other hand, can be included only if they are made with a clear intention of resembling Japanese eroge.

"Lunar is a series of Japanese-style role-playing games, best known for its first two installments, The Silver Star and Eternal Blue, as well as their remakes.

All the games in the series share a common setting, an inhabitable moon called Lunar or Silver Star, which circles around an Earth-like planet known as the Blue Star. The background story of the series includes legends from thousand years ago, when an evil being called Zophar corrupted the hearts of Blue Star's inhabitants, turning them into monsters. The benevolent goddess Althena rescued the survivors; since its was impossible to restore life on Blue Star, she transported them onto the moon, magically turning it into a planet suitable for living. Four dragons guard this world, and heroes called the Dragonmasters protect it from danger.

Gameplay-wise, Lunar games adhere to traditional Japanese RPG design philosophy, utilizing comparatively simple battle and character customization systems. The games focus on story development and characterization, as well as challenge in combat.

"Atari's SwordQuest series of adventure games.

Contest

In 1983, Atari ran the SwordQuest contest, in which contestants would play the game to get clues (2 numbers) that would lead them to a certain page and panel in the included comic book that contained hidden words.
They then sent in the correct words and their entry and a certain number of contestants were flown out to Atari to compete in a championship game.

In the case of EarthWorld, it was 50 contestants who found the correct clues in the EarthWorld comic book and were trying for a gold Talisman of the Penultimate Truth that had 12 diamonds and the 12 zodiac birthstones around it and a white gold sword on the front.
This item was won in August of 1983 by Steven Bell. It is rumored that Mr. Bell kept the sword but sold the rest for $15,000.

The FireWorld round also had 50 contestants who found the correct clues in the FireWorld comic book. This round was played for the Chalice of Light, which was made of gold and platinum with jewel decorations. This was won by Michael Rideout, who still has it in a safe deposit box.

SwordQuest: WaterWorld was initially sold only through the Atari Fan Club by mail order. Forty-five people found the correct clues in its comic book but only 10 were to compete in the championship round (drawn randomly). They were to compete for the Crown of Life, a gold, jewel-decorated crown.

But before the WaterWorld round was played, Atari was sold and the contest was canceled. The remaining copies of SwordQuest: WaterWorld were sold in stores and SwordQuest: AirWorld, which was in development at the time, was canceled and it and its comic were never released.

The 10 finalists of the WaterWorld round were offered compensation checks of an unknown amount. Steven Bell and Michael Rideout were also offered compensation checks of $15,000 because they would not play a Grand Prize round.

Had the contest continued, the prize for the AirWorld round was to have been the Philosopher's Stone, a large piece of white jade in a gold, jewel-decorated box. The grand prize was to have been the Sword of Ultimate Sorcery, a full-size sword with a silver blade and a gold, jewel-encrusted handle.

What became of the crown and stone is unknown. It is rumored that the sword was kept by Jack Tramiel, but this is unconfirmed.

The Atari SwordQuest contest prizes were created by the Franklin Mint.

The franchise became a flagship property for the Xbox consoles of Microsoft, which also owns the intellectual property.

Starting with Halo 4, 343 Industries (later Halo Studios), established in 2007 by Microsoft, continued the Halo series with the second trilogy.

All official games in the series are 3D first-person shooters, but a fan team created the 2D side-scrolling shooter Halo Zero. Bungie created a Nintendo DS demo as an unsolicited pitch, but nothing came of it eventually. The series' most prominent character is Master Chief.

In September 2008, it was revealed Ensemble Studios had been working on a Halo MMO since 2006, though not continually, but the project was eventually cancelled by Microsoft. Instead, the development on the strategy title Halo Wars was continued.

The games were used to create the popular machinima Red vs. Blue, which ran from 1 April 2003 until 28 June 2007 with 100 episodes. It was conceived by Rooster Teeth Productions and was distributed primarily through the Internet and DVD.

"This group includes games based on the setting and rules of the pen-and-paper role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade by Mark Rein-Hagen, which is a part of White Wolf Studio's World of Darkness universe. The main theme of the setting is the continuous existence of vampires within the human society, concealed by their ""masquerade"", i.e. efforts to pass as humans, both visually and spiritually.

Most vampires in this universe try to keep in touch with their human side; in the role-playing rules, this translates into a special ""humanity meter"". Committing particularly immoral and violent actions will lower this meter; once it reaches the minimum, a vampire connects fully to its beastly side, entering an uncontrolled frenzy. 

The setting portrays in detail various sects and clans of the vampires. The sects are ideological groups that may comprise vampires of different clans. The most prominent sects are the Camarilla, the dominant vampire organization that is particularly strict with the masquerade rules. Opposed to them are the Anarchs, which consider the Camarilla society corrupt and oppressive. The vampire that belong to the Sabbat are excessively proud of their nature, believing themselves superior to humans and thus not needing to resemble them.

The clans determine the main character traits, statistics, abilities, and weaknesses of a vampire. For example, vampires of the Ventrue clan are distinguished by their leadership skills, often assuming high positions in the hierarchy of the Camarilla, but are bound to feeding restrictions, naturally rejecting the blood of many species; the Malkavians possess unique mind-controlling abilities such as Dementation, but are insane and unable to communicate normally with others; the Nosferatu can transform into animals and are physically strong, but their hideous appearance forces them to live in the sewers in order to keep their masquerade, and so on.",2805,Vampire: The Masquerade licensees

By collecting runes, the player can summon additional heroes to his side. The avatar as well as the heroes can be equipped freely, considering their skills. 

In the RTS part the player summons workers to collect resources and to construct buildings. The buildings are required to train troops which fight the enemies (with or without the help of the avatar / heroes). The player need plans to construct buildings and runes to train troops.

To summon heroes or workers a monument is needed. There are separate monuments for the heroes and for each playable race. In some missions there are no heroes available, other missions have to be completed only with the avatar and the heroes.

The player is often able to make moral decisions, subsequently tending towards the Light or the Dark side of the Force, or remaining neutral.

"One of the most popular football (soccer) management series, as well as one of the most recognizable franchises by Gremlin during the 16-bit computer days, Premier Manager offered the player the chance to climb from the Conference division to the Premier League. However, with the downfall of the Amiga (where the series were more popular), Gremlin discontinued the series.

In 1997 the series returned, taking advantage of Dinamic's PC Fútbol series, which were completely different from the original games, as well as developing internally a PSOne version.

However, Gremlin was acquired by Infogrames in 1999, and folded two years later, but a third rebirth of the series happened at the hands of ZOO Digital.",3072,Premier Manager series
"Conan, The Barbarian is the most famous character created by Robert E. Howard who made his first appearance on the 1932 story The Phoenix on the Sword published in the Weird Tales literary magazine. Over the years Conan grew as a cult icon even past Howard's death mostly thanks to the 60's reprints of the original stories with lush cover paintings by the great Frank Frazetta, which account for most of the character's fame and started the trend of elaborate fantasy illustrations for these types of novels.

To this day Conan remains a successful and influential figure whom most people may remember from 1982's Conan: The Barbarian film starring an unknown Austrian bodybuilder by the name of Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first major role and which spawned a sequel, a spin-off (also with Schwarzenegger) and countless variants and imitators. Produced by Dino de Laurentiis and directed by John Milius, Conan became a hit in its day. The franchise did spawn comic books, post-Howard novels, cartoons and videogames.

Trivia

Howard wrote all of his over 20 Conan stories between 1932 and 1935, the year in which he committed suicide.

"Hearts of Iron is a strategy game that follows the gameplay of Europa Universalis to a certain extent. The game set around World War II. Most usually start roughly at pre WW-II around 1939. Game endings of the series vary.

Hearts of Iron has a top-down perspective, where gameplay is only on a world-political map level. No other perspectives in the series exist. The game is also ""semi real-time"" in gameplay, where you can ""pause"" or slower/faster the speed settings to adjust your strategy. 

Gameplay mostly focuses on global strategy where you play as the supreme ""dictator"" of ANY chosen country at the selected time period. However, the ""story"" of the game revolves around the 3 major alliances during that Era: the Allies, under the leadership of United Kingdom, the Axis under the leadership of Nazi Germany and Komintern under the leadership of Communist Soviet Union.

The purpose of the game is ""technically"" to lead your faction (if you choose to do so) as the winning faction, represented by the number of ""points"" it scores at the game end.",3792,Hearts of Iron series

"Xuanyuan Jian (traditional Chinese 軒轅劍, simplified Chinese 轩辕剑, ""The Sword of Xuanyuan"") is the largest and longest-running series of Taiwanese-made role-playing games, traditionally set in different historical time periods and referring to various Chinese legends and historical events. Created by DOMO, the development team of Softstar Entertainment, the series began its existence with Xuanyuan Jian (1990), one of the first Chinese-made role-playing games.

Background and Setting

The title refers to the Yellow Emperor (Huang Di), the legendary founder of the Chinese civilization, whose real name is said to be Gongsun Xuanyuan (公孫軒轅). According to Chinese legends and historiography, he lived in the 27th century BC, and wielded a powerful sword, which he used to defeat the warlord Chi You, thus heralding the birth of the Chinese nation. The series' lore further develops this concept, stating that the Sword of Xuanyuan was passed through generations of heroes, but also frequently captured by evil warlords and used by them to further their goals. The sword itself appears in every installment of the series, wielded either by a player-controlled character (as the game's ultimate weapon), or by one of the adversaries. 

Xuanyuan Jian games are set in various time periods of the Chinese history, e.g. Qin Dynasty, Three Kingdoms era, Tang Dynasty, and others. In some of the games the setting is pre-historic and/or mythological. Supernatural elements abound in all the games, often used as plot devices to give fictional insights into real events of Chinese history.

Gameplay

Like most Chinese-made RPGs, Xuanyuan Jian games utilize a Japanese role-playing template, characterized by predominantly linear plot advancement, turn-based combat mechanics, and simple leveling-up systems. A recurrent story- and gameplay-related element is the so-called ""Wooden Armor"" (木甲) technique, which traces its origins to the famous real-life Chinese philosopher and scientist, Mozi (墨子, 470 BC – 391 BC), who also appears as a character in some of the games. Mozi was known for creating elaborate mechanical constructions; in the series, he and his pupils possess the ability to animate wooden creatures. These often appear in Xuanyuan Jian games, often as enemies, sometimes as playable characters, having their own gameplay abilities and affinities.

Another recurrent gameplay element is the Spirit Fusion Pot (煉妖壺, ""Lian Yao Hu""), created by the goddess Nüwa. The player uses this pot to combine items and fuse monsters, which can be captured by certain characters who possess a corresponding battle technique. These monsters can be then summoned during combat, aiding the player-controlled party. In some Xuanyuan Jian games, this element has evolved into the Heavenly Book (天書) feature: the player has access to facilities that produce items, weapons, and armor, and require the presence of captured monsters and collection of raw materials.",3904,Xuan-Yuan Sword series
"Xianjian Qixia Zhuan (traditional Chinese 仙劍奇俠傳, simplified Chinese 仙剑奇侠传, literally ""Legend of Magical Sword and Miraculous Heroes"") is a series of Chinese role-playing games and its spin-offs, created by the Taiwanese developer Softstar Entertainment. The games are set in the feudal China, usually not specifying a concrete historical epoch. As in most Chinese-made RPGs, the gameplay follows a predominantly Japanese template, which simple turn-based combat mechanics, automatic leveling up, and linear story advancement. A defining feature of the series is the emphasis on romantic relationships between the hero and the female characters. Some of the installments are connected to each other by recurrent characters and plot elements, though for the most part each one features a new cast of protagonists.

The series has achieved a widespread popularity in Chinese-speaking countries. In 2005, a TV series entitled Chinese Paladin was released, based on the story and characters of the first Xianjian Qixia Zhuan.

Since none of these games was released in the West, there is no official English translation of the series' title, though Softstar used The Legend of Sword and Fairy in documentation and installation routines of some of the games. The series has also been referred to as The Magic Sword and the Chivalrous Youngsters.",3908,Xianjian Qixia Zhuan / Legend of Sword and Fairy series

"Platform games starring Miner Willy. The first game in the series, Manic Miner, was inspired by Miner 2049er.

Mega-tree

Mega-tree was the third in the Miner Willy series and was developed in 1984 by Matthew Smith, Marc Dawson and Stuart Fotheringham. According to Fotheringham, Software Project's management expected them to produce a quick sequel while the development team took their time to discuss gameplay and do research because they wanted to produce ""the best and most innovative game of the time"". In the end, they had only a single mock-up screen when the project progress was reviewed after three months, the game was cancelled and Fotheringham (probably Dawson, too) was fired. 

Miner Willy Meets The Taxman is often cited as aka for Mega-tree, but according to Games That Weren't, it was an entirely different project which never left the planning stages.

Fangames

Fan sequels and level editors for Jet Set Willy were released as early as 1985, thanks to the original game's relatively simple, unencrypted room data format. The series has a fairly robust fangame community to this day (2021).

"Games built around the solid 3D Freescape world from Incentive Software.

Freescape was conceived in 1985 by Chris Andrew. He was inspired by Elite's 3D game engine and was certain that computers of that time had enough power to draw solid 3D polygons instead of wireframe graphics. In September 1986 together with programmer Stephen Northcott and graphic artist Paul Gregory they started creating a system originally codenamed ""Being There"". It was developed in assembler on Amstrad CPC mainly because, according to Chris, ""it was best positioned for development work due to its availability with built-in disk drive plus its processing speed and graphics capabilities, at least capabilities appropriate for 3D."" During the development process the team were facing fairly typical problems in that era: performance and lack of memory. In order to save space, the geometry representation was very high level with relatively low precision. They also invented an efficient format known as Freescape Control Language that held the complex game logic and enabled easy level authoring without bloating data size.

When the system was completed, the team started porting the code to other machines beginning with the Spectrum. It wasn't a hard job because both computers were Z80-based machines. The most difficult task was to port the engine onto the C64. According to Paul Gregory ""the relatively weak main processor on the C64 was a real problem, While various co-processors complemented it, none of them were particularly useful for 3D, so it was up to the main processor to do the grunt work.""",3920,Freescape games

"A series of platform games from Konami that started with Rocket Knight Adventures for the Genesis in 1993. All games star an opossum called Sparkster as the protagonist. A distinct feature of the game is his ability to propel himself into the air using a rocket pack fitted on his back. The games are set in the kingdom Zephyrus, in a world called Ethorn. Sparkster's nemesis is called Axel Gear.

In 1994 the sequel Sparkster was released for the Genesis, along with a spin-off for the SNES using the same name Sparkster, but the latter did not continue the series' storyline.

Sixteen years later the series was rebooted with the release of Rocket Knight in 2010, developed by the UK studio Climax Studios Ltd. as a downloadable title for Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

"Electronic Arts'  third attempt at football management games (following FIFA Soccer Manager and FA Premier League Football Manager 2000), Total Club Manager was designed by Gerald Köhler, a German game designer well known for his work on the design and development of the Anstoß series, developed by Ascaron.

Offering a (comparatively) lighter approach than the leading managing game (SI's Football Manager series), FIFA Manager (the main name used by the franchise since the 2006 version) is closer in style and options to managing games developed in Germany, such as the aforementioned Anstoß series or games distributed or developed by Software 2000 and Bubball, offering many micromanagement options (such as stadium expansions, control of merchandise products and development of club facilities). Another of the main selling points was the usage of FIFA's 3D engine to simulate games.

In the 2004 and 2005 versions, players who owned the managing game along the FIFA release of the same year could play games instead of simulating them. After stopping sharing the same engine, the ability to play returned with the 07 release, although with a large change: it's only possible to control a single player.

On November 23, 2013 it was announced that FIFA Manager 14 (which was already only a re-release of FIFA Manager 13) would be the last game in the series.",4476,Total Club Manager / FIFA Manager series

"This group includes the main (numbered) Final Fantasy games. One of the most popular Japanese-style role-playing series, and the most popular one outside of its homeland, Final Fantasy still holds the record for most numbered games. 

Created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and developed by Square, the series started its existence in 1987 with the first Final Fantasy. The word final in the title implied Sakaguchi's intention to leave the game industry. The game, however, gained such widespread recognition that Sakaguchi changed his mind. Subsequent installments only increased the series' popularity.

Setting and Themes

With a few exceptions, these games are completely unrelated to each other by plot, and may have diverse settings, ranging from traditional medieval fantasy to sci-fi; often various setting styles are combined in the same game. The storylines usually involve confrontations on an epic scale with an abundance of supernatural elements. The series has gradually become notable for fairly complex plots full of dramatic occurrences, and cinematic treatment of cutscenes.

Recurrent elements in setting and storylines usually include minor characters. Traditionally, a character named Cid appears and plays a more or less significant role in every Final Fantasy game. Recurrent races of creatures include the yellow ostrich-like chocobos (often used for gameplay purposes, e.g. riding, breeding, etc.), timid pink creatures called moogles, and others. An airship is a recurrent device used in most Final Fantasy games; in many of them, the player is able to physically navigate it.

Gameplay

Individual installments in the series usually vary significantly in gameplay. Already the first three Final Fantasy games had differences in character management and customization - character classes chosen by the player before the beginning of the game in the first; free-form gradual customization achieved by training in the second; a job system with a variety of classes and abilities in the third. Each of the subsequent games also had a different system, though the basic Japanese-style mechanics with party management and random, predominantly turn-based battles occurring on separate screens have persisted until the eleventh game opted for merging exploration and combat, similarly to Western RPGs.

One of the trademark gameplay elements of the series was the so-called ATB (active-time battle) combat system. First introduced in the fourth game, it added a real-time element to the turn-based battles: the player had to think and act quickly when choosing an action from a menu, since the enemies would act in the meantime and attack without waiting for the turn of the player-controlled party.

Other recurrent gameplay elements include traditional White (healing), Black (offensive), Red (combination of the above), Blue (learned from enemies), and Green (supportive and status-altering) magic, character class traits (ninja, monk, dragoon, etc.) in many of the installments, and the ability to summon and/or customize powerful creatures who would aid the combatants.

Trivia

During the 16-bit console era, the numbering of the games in the series was different in Western countries. Since the second and the third games in the series were not released in the West, the fourth game was called Final Fantasy II there; furthermore, the sixth game was called Final Fantasy III, since the fifth installment also failed to reach the Western countries. This confusion was rectified with subsequent re-releases and remakes of many of these games.

"Delphine's two-part story wordlessly tells, in smooth rotoscoped polygon cinematics, of the tribulations of whiz kid physicist Lester Knight Chaykin in a strange and dangerous alien world found just on the other side of a fluke particle accelerator accident. Captured by alien humanoids and imprisoned with one, their joint escape attempt lays waste to significant portions of a fantastical otherworldly city, as this unlikely pair strives for revenge, justice and freedom. Some scenes and plot elements from the first game are built upon and revisited from his alien buddy's perspective in the second, as loose ends of a larger umbrella narrative are put to rest.

Many fans do not consider the contentious events contained in this sequel as part of the series canon. But contrary to popular belief, Éric Chahi, the original designer of Out of This World, was actually involved to some extent in the initial development of this game. Here's what the man has to say about it:

""The Mega CD version combined two games. On one hand, Another World with CD quality brand new music, made by Jean-François Freitas; and on the other hand, the sequel named Heart of the Alien. Interplay insisted in making the sequel in order to make the most of the CD-ROM medium's capabilities. After discussion, I agreed. Rather than making a chronological development related to the first story, I decided that redesigning the game from the alien point of view was excellent, and would make the player discover Another World with other eyes. I could already picture scenes where Lester would be in the background fighting guards, while the player would control the alien in the foreground and then join our first hero, help him, etc... The concept was good but, alas, neither the animations nor the game, entirely developed by Interplay, were up to the job. It was a flop.""",4870,Another World / Out of This World series

"This group includes all licensed games based on the Japanese anime meta-series Gundam by Sunrise Studios. The franchise started with the TV series Mobile Suit Gundam (機動戦士ガンダム), spanning 43 episodes and having aired in 1979-1980. Written and directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, it is considered the foundation of the ""real robot"" current in the mecha genre, in which the technology behind the human-controlled robots is based on hard sci-fi concepts. This comes in contrast to the loosely-explained ""super robots"". The series persevered and hundreds of products followed, including TV anime series, movies (even live-action ones), manga, novels, toys, video games, and other merchandise.

While the franchise has explored different themes across the years, including by creating parallel universes in order to give their creative teams more freedom, the Universal Century timeline (featured in the original trilogy and the movie Char's Counterattack, among others) has remained the most popular setting. In it, the people have managed to colonize space by building huge colonies orbiting in the Earth-Moon pair's Lagrangian points. The people living in space have grown dissatisfied with being ruled by Earth, and in 2079 the Principality of Zeon has declared independence. What followed was a series of wars between the Zeon-controlled colonies and the Earth Federation, as well as minor conflicts in their aftermath. Viewers usually witness the events from the perspective of the Gundam pilot. The Gundam is initially a prototype mobile suit created by the Earth Federation, but later is transformed into a whole line of improved mobile suits based off the original idea. Because the Gundams are in a class of their own, they play an important role in all conflicts.

The Gundam meta-series has a fetish for robot-to-robot battles, but spaceships also play an important role. It tackles other themes as well, including: people born in space developing telepathic capabilities (newtypes), dirty politics detached from the needs of the common folk, pollution on Earth both as a cause for expansion into space and as proof of humans' unworthiness etc. There's a large cast of recurring characters, but it is considered tradition for every new major series to have a new Gundam, and a new pilot for it.

The Gundam games are a diverse sort. The SD Gundam World: Gachapon Senshi series for the Famicom and the games developed by Family Soft are turn-based strategies. There's an earlier Famicom title called Mobile Suit Z Gundam: Hot Scramble, which was part side-scrolling action, part first-person rail shooter in space--this was the first Gundam game on consoles. One of the earliest titles in the franchise was Last Shooting for MSX, featuring a first-person view of a Gundam's cockpit and tasking the player to shoot enemy Zakus and other mobile suits. The cockpit idea in an FPS was developed further over the years, most notably in the Arcade Kidō Senshi Gundam: Senjō no Kizuna, in which players step into a sit-down panoramic optical display cabinet. A significant importance in the late 90s and at the beginning of the new millennium had the 2D fighting games (including the Battle Master and Battle Assault series) and the Dynasty Warriors clones.

The first Gundam game to be released in the West was Gundam 0079: The War for Earth, which also has the honor of being the first to be developed outside Japan, by Presto Studios, of Journeyman Project fame.

"Marathon is a series of sci-fi first-person shooters by Bungie, which share a common setting, recurrent characters, and an overarching story. It is considered one of the flagship series of the Macintosh computer. The events of the series begin in 2794 aboard the starship U.E.S.C. Marathon, near a colony on the planet Tau Ceti IV. A security officer must defend the ship against the onslaught of an alien race known as Pfhor. As the series evolves, the ship's AI Durandal begins to play an important role in the plot, interfering in the conflict with its own agenda.

The first Marathon (1994) introduced several notable features to the FPS genre, including the ability to look and aim up and down, dual-wielding weapons, health-recharging machines mounted to walls (instead of health kit pick-ups), and others. The games in the series retain common gameplay elements, such as mission-based stage progression and communication with computers, which is often necessary to acquire information about the plot.",5233,Marathon series

Manhunter 2: San Francisco (1989) was the last commercial game published by Sierra using the AGI engine as the engine could no longer compete with other adventure game engines at that time, and was replaced by the Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine. The AGI engine however, continues to be used to create unofficial (shareware/freeware) AGI games by nostalgic individual programmers and companies.

"The Guild Wars world is split into the continents of Tyria, Cantha and Elona - those correspond to the Guild Wars (now called Guild Wars: Prophecies), Guild Wars: Factions and Guild Wars: Nightfall campaigns (game entries) below.

Each package contains a key-code with which you can either create a new account, or expand an existing one. The benefits/downsides of both ways are:
* Each single account gives you four character slots, but your existing characters can't travel to the other account's continents.
* Merging new codes into an existing account allows all your characters to access the entire world you own, but your new character slots are limited (4 slots for the base account, plus 2 new slots per additional campaign).

So you either have 3 standalone games or 1 base game and 2 Add-Ons. However, this does not mean that Factions and Nightfall are the Add-Ons. If the player first buys Nightfall it becomes the base game, and both Factions and - how paradox it may sound - Guild Wars (Prophecies) the Add-Ons.

The only true Add-Ons are Guild Wars: Eye of the North and the Bonus Mission Pack.

The Guild Wars packages are also ""split"" into PvE and PvP versions. This works the following way:
* The above mentioned Prophecies, Factions and Nightfall, including all the Collector's/Special/Platinum-Editions are PvE/PvP hybrids. The player plays through PvE and PvP to unlock the PvP content (arenas, skills, weapon upgrades etc.). The player also have access to special low-level arenas and special purpose (""fun"") PvP content (i.e. Faction's Alliance Battle).
* With the (now discontinued) PvP-Editions from below or the current PvP Access Kit and its campaign-based Skill Unlock Packs, players have access to all ""high-level"" PvP content right away, but can't access any PvE content.

Note: players who own only different campaigns can't play PvE together, but all players - including the PvP-only players - can play all the ""high-level"" PvP together (or against each other).",5325,Guild Wars series

"Clonk started out as a very basic action game by Matthes Bender. The original version was just a sequence of 30 predefined rounds in which two players could send out their team to fight in a randomly generated landscape. The distribution of Clonk and its sequels on cover discs of German game magazines have made the number of its fans grow steadily, and today it is one of the most successful Shareware game series in Germany.

With subsequent versions, the games became more and more complex, allowing players to construct buildings, gather and process resources to develop new structures and maintain a working economy,  direct battles and diplomacy and so on. Clonk 4 added total customizability, allowing players to edit or create every object and scenario imaginable, providing a C-like scripting language and allowing exchange between players. This feature, along with the split-screen mode, has since been the most important part of Clonk's success.

All editions of Clonk have been distributed as Shareware. In January 2001, developer Matthes Bender has made all games up to Clonk 4 available as freeware. Clonk Planet was added to the freeware selection a short while after its successor, Clonk Endeavour, had been released.",5445,Clonk series

"Mother is a series of role-playing games created by Shigesato Itoi. Only its second installment was released in the West, as EarthBound (1994). The series distinguishes itself by its often unorthodox sense of humor, and by its somewhat unusual (for the genre) modern-day setting.

Setting and Story

Though the games in the series are set in differently named worlds, they bear resemblance to modern-day countries, in particular North America. Despite the realistic setting, the games contain many supernatural and sci-fi elements such as alien races, time travel, etc. The main characters are different in each game, but the player-controlled party of protagonists always consists of children. Recurrent characters include Giygas, the mastermind of an alien race bent on world domination, who is the main antagonist of the first two games, and a few others. Despite their serious premises, the stories contain elements of parody and satire, many humorous situations and conversations, and popular culture references.

Gameplay

Mother games are Japanese-style RPGs with simple turn-based combat mechanics, predominantly linear story advancement, and automatic leveling up. Instead of featuring a more typical ""world map"", the games have continuous worlds, with hostile and safe areas seamlessly connected to each other. The second and the third game feature an unusual odometer-like hit points (HP) counter; when a character is hit in battle, his/her hit points are depleted gradually, and it is possible to cure a character even if the blow was fatal.

The games feature many strange and unusual items and enemies. Weapons include, next to regular ones (bats, guns, etc.), household items such as frying pans, yo-yos, and others. Enemies range from the more or less traditional animals, zombies, robots, and aliens, to unconventional characters such as new-age hippies, cranky ladies, French kisses of death, and even abstract art.

Canceled installment

The third installment of the series, Mother 3 (2006) is based on an unreleased game EarthBound 64, which was in development for the Nintendo 64 platform and canceled in 2000. Mother 3 retains much of the story-related and gameplay content of EarthBound 64, but, due to the limitations of its handheld platform, features old-style 2D graphics, as opposed to the 3D of the unreleased installment.",5559,Mother / EarthBound series

Z-Code is an Interactive Fiction software platform which originates from Infocom's Z-machine virtual machine software solution. All game information are stored in a platform-independent data file, so once you had developed a Z-Code interpreter for a given platform, all Z-Code games could run on it -- a massive save on time and money. 

After the demise of Infocom, people decoded the file format and began to develop interpreters for newer platforms. Also the Z-Code standard was developed further, allowing for graphics, sound and other improvements.

"Söldner: Secret Wars is a massive multiplayer warfare game, similar to the Battlefield series, with battles in the air, on land, and, with the introduction of the Marine Corps expansion, on water. The game was developed by the German studio Wings Simulations GmbH who have a history in warfare games, and was published by JoWooD Productions Software AG.

The game was first announced in a press release on 22nd May 2002, but was ultimately rushed out two years later under pressure of the publisher, with a few bugs and features that were left out. Although the initial release gathered some bad reviews because of this, the developer promised to continue working on the game, and sent out a massive amount of patches - both fixing bugs as introducing new vehicles, weapons, maps and features.

A few months after the initial release, the game reappeared in stores as Söldner: Secret Wars - Reloaded, incorporating many of the patches. Regardless of the efforts, JoWood decided to close the development division in January 2005. A few developers were kept aboard to continue providing support for the game, as well as to complete the expansion Söldner: Marine Corps. It was released in March 2005.

With strong ties to the community, they got help from a team known as Project-Z development. They were originally working on a total conversion for the game, called Iraqi Deliverance, but when the Wings development team was reduced, they canned it and decided to work on the original game. In May 2005, the game's full source code was handed over to the new team and the first patch that involved Project-Z was v33668, released in February 2006.

In May 2006, the game was re-released for the North American market as Semper Fidelis: Marine Corps. It incorporates both the original game and the expansion in a single game, but with no reference to the Söldner franchise to avoid associations with the bad press initially received.

Things went awry when patch 33672 was released on 23rd July 2006. Many players were unable to connect and things heated up as certain members of Project-Z claimed the patch was untested. A JoWood representative demanded the project to be taken out of the hands of Matthijs Beleen, who led Project-Z. It was handed over to a new development team, gEasy, made up of developers who had left the Project-Z team because of the troubles. They released the 33673 patch two days later, correcting the mistakes.

The gEasy team then started working on Söldner 2 until it was cancelled in October 2007.",5795,Söldner series

"Counter-Strike is a series of multiplayer first-person shooters primarily developed by Valve Corporation that focus on competitive battles between teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists. Counter-Strike began as a modification developed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe for Valve's Half-Life. Impressed with the mod, Valve hired Le and Cliffe and turned Counter-Strike into a retail product, which they released as Half-Life: Counter-Strike. It was later made as a standalone game in 2003 on Valve's then-new Steam digital distribution platform, after which it was most commonly known as Counter-Strike 1.6.

In 2004, Valve released Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, a reworked version of the original game with two singleplayer campaigns, and Counter-Strike: Source, a port of the game to Valve's new Source engine. In 2012, Valve released Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a completely modernized take on the series. Valve continued to support Global Offensive with regular updates and sponsored competitive tournaments until it was replaced by Counter-Strike 2 in 2023.

There have also been several official third-party spinoff titles developed for Asian gaming markets over the years. The first, Counter-Strike Neo, is an arcade game that was released exclusively in Japan by Namco in 2003.

"This game group is dedicated to games where its primary (or secondary) gameplay focuses on trading/bartering goods, resources, or items for a profit. The player usually plays the role of an individual travelling trader, or merchant company, or a nation, with the process of trading conducted manually (not computer automated). Depending on the game, profit may be obtained by the player through manually selecting and buying goods in one location and selling them at another location (shops, towns, planets, etc.).

Merchant / trade-oriented games usually have the following characteristics:



Obtaining profit through trade is usually explicitly expressed throughout the game or through official sources (e.g. game manual, etc.). 

Trade must be conducted by the player manually. Thus, gameplay may consist of the player researching goods and price differences for a profitable route.

Computer-assisted scripts may be provided optionally to the player (e.g. caravan routes, etc.).

Trade goods/items usually have no practical use or additional benefits to the player (e.g. cannot be used or equipped).


Limitations



Does not apply to games where although trade may exist as an integral part of the game, it happens automatically (through a computer animated script which may be manually created within the game) and does not require the manual selling of goods or items (i.e. political/war-themed games such as Sid Meier's Civilization or 4X games). The term trading simulation is commonly used in this respect.

Does not apply to role-playing games (RPGs) or any other genre where items, including weapons and armor, may be available for buying and selling, but where such transactions aren't done solely for the sake of profit as a main gameplay feature, unless the game optionally and explicitly expresses trade as an integral part of the gameplay.

Does not apply to games where the player may buy or sell parts/accessories for the player's car, rubber ducky, spaceship, or other forms of transportation.

Does not apply to sport-themed managerial games, where the player can buy or sell players, etc.

Not to be confused with managerial games, which although they're focusing on managing resources, usually have the trade aspect handled automatically.

Historically, the term barbarian was used to identify uncivilized cultures in the classical world, other than the Romans or the Greeks, usually referring to the Persians, Germanic and Celtic nations, as well as tribes occupying today's Eastern Europe.

Conan the Barbarian would be a fitting example in this regard.

Not to be confused with Protagonist: Caveman.

Limitations





Some games may allow the player to choose a protagonist belonging to the barbarian class. These games should not be included unless a barbarian is the only selectable protagonist.




Vikings are usually not classified as barbarians. Thus, they should be excluded from this game group.

"Games that deal with the theme of piracy in a naval sense. Historically, sea piracy and buccaneering are not limited to a specific time period nor are they limited to particular territorial waters (although the term buccaneer itself is limited to pirates operating in the Caribbean).

It's safe to say that ever since ship vessels were first built, there have been persons attempting to prey upon those ships and its cargo.

Note: Sea piracy is probably best known for its setting in the Caribbean from 1560 to 1730 (often known as the Golden Age of Piracy). Pirates attacking ships on behalf of a nation are known as privateers after they acquired a letter of marque. However, for the context of this group, any game that features a strong element or atmosphere of naval piracy is allowed.

Limitations:





For strategy games, the gameplay should identify the ability of the player to attack other ships in sea battles, which may include: boarding another ship, looting goods from defeated enemy ships, attacking sea forts from the sea, etc. The most obvious example for this is the Pirates! series.




For adventure games or other genres that do not fulfill the requirement of the aforementioned, a pirate theme must explicitly be noticed within the game. The most obvious example for this is the Monkey Island series.




In accordance to the first requirement, space pirates or games that refer to space piracy are excluded from this game group (see: Genre: Simulation - Space trading and combat).

"Games that are inspired by vampires, a mythological undead creature of the night that feeds on the blood of the living in order to survive. A person supposedly becomes a vampire either when bitten by another vampire or through the dark arts of necromancy. The characteristics of vampires are widely diverse (some hate garlic, others eat them :p) depending on territorial myth/folklore, legend, or pop culture. The closest original source of the vampire myth may have originated from the Romanian Strigoi mythological creature.

Vampires today however, are usually referred to Western or local European cultures, greatly influenced by either Christian or Jewish mythology. May also include Chinese vampires, who like to jump up and down like bunnies (seriously). These vampires may include some of the several characteristics (specifications may vary):





Undead (the creature is already dead, brought to life through unnatural means). May include other non-traditional means, such turning into a vampire through black magic, necromancy, or joining an accountant firm.




Appearance may strike as pale as such person(s) not exposed to sunlight, similar to a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) fanboi.




Drinks blood for survival and healing purposes. Vampires are equipped with supposedly two pointed teeth for this purpose. Usually targets the victim via main blood artery at the neck. Later adaptations include blood arteries at the wrist.




Exposure to direct sunlight is considered lethal. The traditional 'stake through the heart' has a similar effect. Though a head-shot with a shotgun may result a similar desired effect (especially if loaded with silver bullets). Later adaptations however have introduced day walkers, referring to a vampire hybrid entirely unharmed by sunlight.




Weakened (or allergic in scientific terms) by garlic, holy symbols (e.g. crucifix, blessed/holy water, etc.), people with diabetes; cannot cross over running water, etc.




May have shape-shifting magical abilities, such as transforming into certain beast-like creatures: wolves, bats, rats, etc. No evidence has shown a vampire transforming into a Pokémon monster.




May cast no reflections as they have no souls. Then again, neither do lawyers.




May have the ability to charm the opposite sex (or anyone for that matter) or possesses overwhelming charisma almost equal to the approvers of MobyGames™, in order to manipulate individuals to do their bidding. This is the part where you should start getting suspicious.



In pop culture, the myth of vampires have either been greatly influenced by two of the following fictional vampires, more so by the latter:



A movie: Nosferatu (1922);

A novel: Bram Stoker's: Dracula (1897).


Limitations  



For purposes of this game group, games where vampires do not play a predominate role in the plot/story/theme or are identified merely as random enemies, should be excluded from this game group.

"This sub-genre goes by many names, such as ""Gravity shooters"", ""Cave-flyers"", ""Thrust-types"", ""Gravitors"". This is a type of shoot 'em up in which the protagonist pilots a rotatable craft with thrusters (similar to Asteroids) while being subject to gravity and, often, the craft's inertia. Gravity shooters feature multi-directional, 360 degree, movement and shooting. They also feature free-scrolling stages that allow the players to roam freely around the map and approach targets however they wish. The action is presented in a side-view and usually takes place in enclosed, cavern-like, environments (thus, the term ""Cave-flyers"") filled with various types of enemies and hazards. Using the ship's ""rotate &amp; thrust"" capabilities, the players must aim, shoot, dodge and carefully maneuver their way through the landscape while constantly taking gravity and (usually) fuel refill needs into account.

The most classic examples of this type of shoot 'em up are Gravitar and Thrust. Atari's Gravitar (1982) created most of the genre's conventions (thus, the term ""Gravitors""). However it wasn't until Thrust (1986) was released (and ported to almost every home computer available at the time) that the genre gained some popularity. The genre flourished in Europe from the mid-80s to mid-90s on 8-bit home computers, Atari ST, Amiga and PC. Inspired by Thrust, many commercially released gravity-based shooters were developed in Europe during this time period, giving birth to the terms ""Gravity shooter"" and ""Thrust-type"". The phenomenon included numerous caveflier games published by young Finnish coders and shareware groups which spread around quickly through BBS systems and the registered versions were popular at copy parties. In the early 90s, the genre even ventured in multiplayer-focused games, with titles such as GF2, AUTS and Turboraketti II becoming popular among home computer users.",6133,Genre: Cave-flyers and Thrust variants

Universe

The setting of Neopets.com is Neopia, a planet inhabited by the tens of species of the titular creatures, who resemble dragons, kittens, bats, etc. Like any self-respecting fantasy land, Neopia has medieval kingdoms, spooky nightmarish lands, floating cities, as well as a healthy dose of monsters and other odd beings. When it comes to the status of the Neopets themselves, the website is rather schizophrenic. On one hand, the website has the players adopt Neopets as--uh--pets to care for: this involves feeding the Neopet, playing with it to keep it happy, pitting it against other Neopets in the ""Battledome"", and treating it like a housepet in general. On the other hand, in most of the official Neopets.com games, lore and stories, Neopets are depicted as sapient creatures that inhabit Neopia like any normal civilization, and humans are absent. 

Browser games

Apart from the computer and console games, the Neopets.com website is rife with online games to play; most can be played without registering an account on the website.

The license with the original creator Steve Purcell expired in May 2005 and he took it to Telltale Games. The sequel was released in episodic nature between October 2006 and May 2007, with six standalone installments forming a single season. Two additional seasons were released in 2007-2008 and 2010, respectively. Following Telltale's demise, the license for the three seasons was acquired by Skunkape Games to develop their remasters.

"Note: Due to varied myth, legend, folklore, and historical sources, information provided here may not be 100% accurate.

Historically known as the Matter of Britain or more commonly known as the Arthurian Legends, are Celtic and Welsh based tales surrounding the myth of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table set at the Kingdom of Camelot. Though many historical references note the possible existence of King Arthur and his knights (earliest reference dates to 594? AD), varied sources and numerous retellings (greatly influenced by Christian, Celtic, and Welsh mythology) result in difficulty of identifying historical fact from mythological fiction. Later retellings of the legend were made more popular during the 12th-13th century of medieval chivalry.

"Guitar Hero is a series of music/rhythm games where players use a guitar-shaped peripheral to simulate playing the guitar to music tracks. In later versions other instruments were introduced such as drums and a microphone for the vocals. Multiple players can participate at the same time and various versions of the peripherals were released with each version. The first three games in the series were developed by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc. and the initial publisher, RedOctane, Inc. was soon after the release of the first game acquired by Activision Publishing, Inc.. Future installments in the series were developed by Neversoft Entertainment. Harmonix was acquired by MTV Networks and did not own the rights to the game mechanics and name. They continued with the game Rock Band, a similar concept but with additional instruments such as drums and a microphone.

The first two games in the series focus on rock songs, the third game has an eighties theme. From the fourth game onwards (Guitar Hero: World Tour) more instruments were introduced to focus on the band experience, following the example of Rock Band. Next to mobile versions there were also spin-offs such as Band Hero (2009) and the DJ Hero series with turntable mixing. The concept was expanded to band-centric games based on groups such as Aerosmith, Metallica and Van Halen. The last major game in the series was Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock. Music game sales took a sharp dive in 2010 and that led to the demise of the competing Rock Band series. The same happened to Guitar Hero, as publisher Activision Blizzard announced in February 2011 that the franchise would be discontinued.

Demakes of the concept* Heroes in Guitarland (Windows, but NES-like)
* Shredz64 (Commodore 64)

"Games that feature alchemy as a part of gameplay. For purposes of this game group, alchemy is defined as:

""The use of one or several ingredients with or without the use of certain apparatus to create a certain outcome in the form of a potion, spell, or similar devices"".

Acquiring ingredients for alchemy purposes within the game may be through herb gathering via adventuring, defeating monsters, or buying at a local shop/alchemist. Alchemy also often requires the use of certain apparatus other than ingredients or recipes (e.g. philosopher's stone, alchemist bench, disposable refrigerator, etc.).

  

An alchemist apparatus with an ingredient shelf from the game Dragon Lord/Dragon's Breath.

Limitations





The inventory of alchemy used in the game has to be somewhat large. Thus, games that only have two leaves just to create a potion (and only those two leaves in the game) are excluded from this group. Any game that identifies more than 10 (ten) ingredients that can be used for alchemy should qualify for this game group.




This is not an alchemy-themed based game group. Games must include the process of alchemy as part of the game play. So puzzle games or adventure games where the player chases an alchemist around (without actually doing any alchemy) are out.

"A series of adventure games centered around members of the Blackwell family and the ghost Joey Malone, created by David Gilbert. The Blackwells solve mysterious cases together with Joey, a ghost who has lived with members of her family for many generations, and is passed on to a new host when that person dies.

The series was started in 2003 with the freeware game Bestowers of Eternity, but never continued. In fact, the game ends when Rosangela Blackwell first meets Joey. In December 2006, the commercial title The Blackwell Legacy was released. It is partly a remake of the original game, but continues the storyline as Rosangela and Joey go on their first assignment.

In July 2007, blowie released the parody The Crackwell Legacy as a freeware AGS adventure game.

The series was continued in September 2007 with the release of Blackwell Unbound, a prequel to the previous two games, starring Lauren Blackwell. The content of this game was initially a part of The Blackwell Convergence, as a flashback, but cut eventually. When it grew too big and it would take too long to develop, Dave Gilbert returned to the cut part and decided to expand it and turn it into a full game, prior to the release of Convergence in July 2009.

"The games within the Silent Storm game group are similar to the Jagged Alliance games. The player controls a team of soldiers which is sent into enemy territory. As long as the enemy does not detect the soldiers, you can move and interact with the environment in real-time. However, combat is turn-based where all actors have action-points. Action-points are required for all kinds of actions like moving, shooting or the usage of skills. If an actor runs out of action-points, he is not able to do anything until the next combat round starts.

Beside these tactical part of the game, there are also RPG aspects within the game. Each actor belongs to a class and each class has an own ability-tree. By gathering experience the actors gain new levels and in each level a ability point is provided. The ability point can be used to learn a new ability. In contrast to that, all classes have the same attributes and skills. The skills are increased by just using them. The attributes are linked to the skills, so using a skill will slowly also increase the attribute.",6878,Silent Storm universe

A common point in most Atlantis-related speculations is the supposedly high technological level of the Atlantean civilization.

A fifth Spectrum game called Mire Mare, which was already hinted at in Underwurlde and Pentagram, was cancelled.

It is also known that the game would have returned to the graphics style of Underwurlde.

Another game called Sabreman Stampede was in development for some time.

At the trade station the player has also the opportunity to buy new equipment for the ships.

The RPG part consists of equipping the ships with new weapons and devices as well as spending experience points to unlock new abilities.

OOTP sees a host of new features added every year, and it has grown to include many things not found in other baseball management games, including the posting system for international players (the game features leagues in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other countries), an international player development complex for young players discovered by scouts in other countries, full minor leagues down through short A and rookie ball, summer leagues in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, and more.

In 2011, OOTP publisher Out of the Park Developments added a mobile version, iOOTP Baseball 2011, for iOS devices. That game also added an MLB license in 2015 and was rebranded MLB Manager. That year, MLB Manager added support for Android devices too.",7226,Out of the Park series

"God of War is a series of action games with puzzle-solving elements, set in the fictional world of Greek mythology. The games in the series are united by a common storyline and feature a recurrent protagonist, the ruthless warrior Kratos, who, during the course of the series, defeats popular heroes, monsters, and deities of the ancient Greek myths. The series started its life with God of War (2005), created by David Jaffe.

Story

The overarching story is dedicated to Kratos, originally a mortal warrior, on a quest for revenge - initially against Ares, the god of war, but in later installments also against other Olympic gods. Each main entry in the series is a direct continuation of the previous installment's story; the spin-offs are mostly ""interquels"", i.e. their events take place between those described in the main games.

Gameplay

The gameplay of the series has elements of ""beat-'em-up"" games, with their heavy emphasis on close combat with combo moves. Kratos' main weapons are always double chain blades; in each game, he learns a variety of combo moves, special attacks, and magic. Quick-time events are used liberally in many fights. By collecting orbs dropped by defeated enemies, the player can upgrade Kratos' physical attacks and magical abilities.

The games also incorporate many elements of a 3D platformer, with timed jumps and other precision-based tasks. Puzzle-solving usually involves manipulating the environment (pushing, pulling, and otherwise re-arranging objects), as well as using Kratos' special abilities to solve the puzzle. These abilities (such as for example gliding, stopping time, and others) may be shared by the entire series or limited to individual installments. 

God of War games are notable for their large amount of brutal and gory scenes, many of which depict actions committed by the protagonist. An additional indicator of the adult-oriented nature of the series are sex mini-games, which allow the player to control Kratos' movements during the act.",7242,God of War series

"Various implementations of John Horton Conway's mathematical cellular automata simulation the Game of Life (and not the Milton-Bradley board game of the same name.)

John Horton Conway's inspirations for this game included John Von Neumann's notion of self-replicating machines and John Leech's problems in group theory.

Upon initial publication, Conway offered a $50 prize to anyone who could devise a pattern within the year that would grow and expand indefinitely -- a prize claimed by Bill Gosper of MIT and since expanded to a wide range of ""guns"" and ""gliders.""

A curious side-effect of these growing patterns is that the conditions provided by the stock rules of the Game of Life make it a Universal Turing machine, predictable cell population movements providing analogues to counters, logic gates and finite state machines.

The first computer implementation of Conway's Life, in 1970 quick on the heels of the game's initial introduction, was made for the PDP-7 by M. J. T. Guy and S. R. Bourne.

Trivia

The Game of Life was originally conceived using plates put on Conway's tiled kitchen floor.

Games in this group have no HUD at all during proper gameplay.

A general rule of thumb is that if the original game has levels, and most or all of them are recognizable in the new game, but it is also clear that the developers re-created them, then it's an enhanced remake.

The Guild 2 series

Introduction

The Guild 2 series is set medieval Europe, where the player takes on the role of a male or female business person who aims to make a new competitive family-based business enterprise. The player must first choose a scenario (there are usually no campaign modes) which consists of a map overview of the area to be played. The map displayed available towns (and its buildings), maximum available players, and resources. Difficulty will depend on the availability of surrounding resources as well opposing families.

Character Classes  

The player may choose a character class which will dictate actions and early economic choices for the player's family. As of the latest version of games in this series, the available character classes are as of the following:
* The Craftsman;
* The Patron;
* The Scholar;
* The Rogue.

Each class has unique abilities as well as buildings that may provide goods or access to certain service capabilities. Later versions of The Guild may provide more building and goods variations.

Family Business and Production  

The game suggests the player to build a dynasty consisting of various family members who will then help operate business enterprise. First the player must choose a starting class, which will dictate accessibility to buildings unique to each class. These buildings when bought or build in available land plots will serve as the foundation of the player's business and income, which may later be upgraded.

To start a family dynasty the player must woo and wed a non-player character (NPC) and later commence in 'medieval rituals' to produce offspring. All family members may be controlled if the player chooses to do so, however children may not be controlled, but when of certain age may be sent off for apprenticeship and schooling. Each family member will have their own (and possibly different) classes, which may also allow the player access to new buildings not available to the player's starting character.

Production, depending on whether a particular building produces goods or services, usually requires natural resources, manufactured goods, or other related items to produce a items or profitable goods. Natural resources may be gathered by sending in employees (which are hired from the building menu) or any member of the player's family and later using those goods to produce a specified item. These newly produced items may then be used for personal usage (if applicable), stored in an owned warehouse, personally sold by owned buildings at a lower price, or sold at markets for a higher price. Selling goods at markets usually offer the highest margin of income, however the price may fluctuate, depending on the availability of goods in the market. Prices may drop if supply of mentioned goods exceed demand, either due to supply from the player or other NPC competitors.

Political Intrigue  

In addition to business, the game series also offers local politics as an integral part of the gameplay, although participating in politics is completely optional. To enter politics, the player purchases a title and must apply for a position at the town hall (some versions may not require a title for the lowest positions). At an appointed time, a vote will be decided in a town meeting to consider each applicant. In order to win the vote, the player must have good relations with person(s) who are eligible to vote. To do so, the player may use social approaches such as bribery, gifts, flirtation, and many other available intrigue in the game to increased the 'relationship meter' between the player and the intended target.

Role-Playing Elements  

Although primarily a strategy game, games in this series also features character development. All players (and NPCs) have talents (attributes) as well as skills (character perks), which may be increased as a character levels up through experience. Experience may be obtained by successfully carrying out duties or specified tasks and the player will be notified when the character obtains such experience.",7978,The Guild series

"A group for games prominently featuring zombies. Although it is unclear where in mythology zombies have originated from, they have been identified to originate from sources as early as Norse mythology to even earlier Sumerian mythology (though distinction between the undead in general is unclear). The zombie definition and its variations are more commonly known to be of African or Haitian voodoo-related origins (i.e. Haitian snake god Zombi). Interpretations of popular culture from classic role-playing games, cult novels, movies, with influences from mentioned mythologies, have later formed a consensus on the characteristics of the zombie. Zombies, based on the aforementioned interpretations may traditionally have one or more of the following traits:



Undead beings, usually summoned forth by necromancers or by other means of dark magic.

Nocturnal creatures, rarely active during the day-time or where sunlight is present.

Usually inhabits graveyards, catacombs or ritually unclean (unholy) sites, feeding on other dead corpses (and living creatures foolish enough to venture near).

Usually slow-moving, mindless, suffers various stages of decomposition and a serious lack of personal hygiene.

Wears shredded or torn clothing, almost similar to the fashion sense of the 1980s and heavy metal bands :p.


In video gaming, zombies were brought to the spotlight by games such as Resident Evil and House of the Dead. Later interpretations, no longer limit zombies to humanoid creatures or products of dark magics. Apparently, zombies now can run without losing their legs in the process and may be created from laboratory-engineered viruses or other sci-fi elements.

Limitations



Although arguably similar one way or the other, mummies, liches, vampires, wraiths, and person(s) inhabiting retirement homes, should be excluded from this game group. Please limit zombies to the common or popular understanding of zombies as aforementioned and tell grandpa he doesn't belong here (yet). Also, games based on the monster in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein are excluded in that that character was no longer dead when he was walking but had been returned to life. Also, he has his own game group.

"Variant home conversions of the mid-1970s mainframe fantasy role-playing game DND that was very successful and spawned dozens of variants. DND is a 2D, top-down, dungeon crawl, similar to Rogue-like games, but with some differences.

For example, most traditional DND-likes don't have random dungeon level generation. They mostly feature one or more fixed levels, albeit often with randomly generated monsters and treasure.

Another defining feature of ""DND-likes"" is the limited view of the surrounding. During dungeon exploration, the player is only shown the immediately adjacent 3x3 fields (although some DND variants have a larger view). This window follows the character, who is always displayed in the center. The player is not shown an overview of the level; in contrast, traditional Rogue-likes display the whole map level map, with the player avatar moving on screen. (DND-like games are infamous for the amount of map-drawing required by players, even if some have automapping to relieve the player -- the first being the mainframe game orthanc in as early as 1976!). 

Traditional DND-likes are single-character crawls and have turn-based gameplay; however, some later games added party support and real-time play (notable is the home computer rpg classic Telengard); these variants can be included here as long as they stick to the non-random level and limited surrounding view criterion.

Many early 2D top-down rpg's lie halfway between Roguelikes and DND-likes. Games like Randall Masteller's Warriors of Ras games (non-random levels, full view) or Automated Simulations' Dunjonquest games (non-random levels, limited view, but moving character and page-flipping) should not be added here.",8045,DND versions

The rules can be summarized as follows: each turn, a player can either move one of his pieces two spaces away, or clone one of his pieces onto a neighboring cell. If the newly moved or cloned piece ends up adjacent to some enemy pieces, it converts them into its color so that they go under the player's control.

"D3Publisher's successful line of Japanese PlayStation budget releases, usually named something like ""THE xxxx"". Though most games are original creations, some of them are budget re-releases of previous full-price games, with a new ""THE xxxx"" name. There were a total of 104 games released under this label.

Several of them saw release in the US and EU under different names, most of them fairly late in the Playstation's life cycle.

Two complementary lines of releases were available alongside the main one. These were:  

Simple 1500 Series Hello Kitty, which only contained licensed games featuring the Sanrio mascot. Four games were released under this label.  

Simple 1500 Jitsuyou Series, which was a ""utility"" series label featuring non-games such as feng shui for the home, tarot fortune telling and more. There were 18 releases made under this label.

"Like a Dragon, (Japanese: 龍が如く, Ryū ga Gotoku) originally as localized as Yakuza, is a series of games created by Amusement Vision and successor Ryu ga Gotoku Studio, and published by Sega. The main games in the series are set in modern-day Japan, and revolve around the local organized crime scene. Inspired by the popular yakuza movie genre, the games incorporate elements of fighting, role-playing, and ""sandbox""-style city exploration with a variety of mini-games.

Story

The Japanese title refers to the series' main protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu, known as the Dragon of the Dojima family. Loyal to the Tokyo-based Tojo clan, Kazuma is depicted as an honest, noble-hearted man who opposes corrupted and villainous members of the yakuza. Throughout the course of the series, Kazuma and other protagonists become involved in complex plots and conspiracies featuring a large number of characters and organizations. The story is frequently advanced by cinematic cutscenes. Plot twists and dramatic effects are utilized liberally; however, up until the release of Yakuza: Dead Souls (2012) the games did not contain supernatural elements of any kind.

Gameplay

The gameplay of Yakuza games usually consists of exploration and fighting modes. In the exploration mode, the player navigates the protagonist through heavily populated city districts, either triggering missions by moving to a certain spot, or simply exploring the environment and entering buildings. The player can purchase items in shops, visit restaurants, nightclubs, massage parlors, casinos, etc. Many locations allow the player to participate in various mini-games, e.g. UFO Catcher, bowling, blackjack, golf, and others.

Fights are typically triggered by initiating contact with hostile characters who randomly appear on the streets. The battles usually take place on separate screens. Though firearms can be used, they are often less effective than melee combat. The protagonist can use various moves (punches, kicks, grapples, etc,) to overcome the enemies, as well as use improvised weapons, ranging from baseball bats to the less traditional lamps and bicycles. The execution of special moves might differ depending on the weapon the protagonist is using. Many weapons would break after continuous usage, requiring the player to look for others or resort to hand-to-hand combat.

Role-playing elements are present in the management of finances and experience system, which leads to character customization. The protagonist accumulates experience points and money from battles, and the player is able to upgrade his parameters, techniques and abilities when leveling up. 

Setting

The fictional Kamurocho district, in which much of the action in Yakuza games takes place, is based on the real-world Kabukicho red light district in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo. The district is rather accurately re-created in the game, including popular landmarks that either had their names changed or placed in the game as tie-in advertisements.

"Escape the Room or Room Escape games are a subgenre of adventure games where the object of the game is to find a way out of a single room or location. The difference with traditional adventure games is that there is little to no story, no characters or dialogue, there's more emphasis on logic puzzles and in general the games are shorter. Many games are browser-based created with Adobe Flash and use point-and-click gameplay with a first-person perspective. The player must find hidden items and clues, and combine them to find or unlock the exit.

The genre was popularized by the 2001 game Mystery of Time and Space and 2004's Crimson Room. The genre has proven very prolific, due to relatively short development times and a low threshold for releasing games through web portals. Hundreds of games have been released, in particular on Japanese websites. Some developers release their games episodically, for example The Happy Escape 1–12 and Christmas Escape 1–5.

From browser games to the real world, Escape Rooms have become a global phenomenon in the 2010s. Starting in Japan in 2006, real life Escape Rooms have been opened all over the world, offering family entertainment and corporate team building exercises. Just like in the browser games, participants must work together to find clues and items in order to escape the room, usually with time limit of 60 minutes.",8350,Genre: Escape room

"Games involving ninjas in a major role or with plots involving ninjas.

A ninja (忍者, literally one who bears) is a general term for an agent, used by feudal warlords during the Japanese Sengoku period, who practices in unorthodox covert activities (assassination, espionage, sabotage, etc.) considered to be dishonorable to the ruling samurai class, or a person who practices the art of ninjutsu (忍術), which includes disciplines such as weapon mastery, evasion, disguise, etc. In Japan, the term shinobi, written with the same Chinese characters and having the same meaning, is more commonly used (sometimes also used to refer to a male ninja). A kunoichi is identified to be a female ninja, often using techniques of a geisha. 

Historical references of the ninja vary in myth, thus its accuracy cannot be attained; one myth for example describes this art originating from Chinese warriors who fled their homeland for being persecuted for their philosophical beliefs. These warriors settled in Japan, specifically the mountains of Iga and taught their combat skills to the locals.

In popular culture, as well as its adaption in most video games, the public awareness of the ninja were greatly influenced by the 1980-90s Hollywood movie industry.

"The highest instance in the German rating and censorship system are the courts. Writings (the term includes films, music and video games) can be considered to violate the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB). Whether a writing fulfills the criteria of the StGB is determined by a judge, who will examine the item in question once a petition is filed against it. If the judge comes to the conclusion that the writing violates StGB, he will issue a confiscation order.

The consequences of confiscation go beyond being listed on the BPjM's Index: it is illegal to sell the item (not only to minors, but to all adults), to own it with the intent of selling, to publicly present it and more. It is not illegal, however, to simply own it and use it in the privacy of one's home. Confiscated writings are automatically listed on the BPjM's index. While the BPjM cannot decide which games get confiscated, they can file a petition for it. They do this for writings which they consider a violation of StGB (they enter those into ""List B"" of the Index). The judge examining the case may or may not agree with the BPjM. If he does not, the writing is usually transferred to ""List A"".

This group includes games that have been confiscated according to section 131 of StGB, which criminalizes writings ""which describe cruel or otherwise inhuman acts of violence against human or human-like beings in a manner which expresses a glorification or rendering harmless of such acts of violence or which represents the cruel or inhuman aspects of the event in a manner which injures human dignity"".

"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a series of first-person shooters by the Ukrainian developer GSC Game World, set in the mysterious radioactive ""Zone"" in the Ukraine. The setting is based on Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky's sci-fi novella Roadside Picnic (1971), but also mirrors a real-life event, the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster of 1986, and the subsequent transformation of the area surrounding it into the Zone of Alienation. The games follow an alternate timeline in which a second disaster occurred in 2006, increasing the anomalies and leading to the birth of mutated creatures in the Zone. The title's acronym stands for Scavenger, Trespasser, Adventurer, Loner, Killer, Explorer, Robber, the principal character types encountered in the games, but also refers to the ""stalkers"", explorers of the mysterious Zone. 

The games are distinguished by their combination of first-person shooter mechanics, an open-ended world, and role-playing elements such as heavy inventory management, the ability to purchase and sell items, limited character customization (equipping artifacts), many side missions that can be completed in a non-linear fashion, and a reputation system that allows the player to perform quests and support one of the factions present in the games.

"Not necessarily licensees of the children's book series by the same name (Choose Your Own Adventure gamebook adaptations) but games following the same basic hyperfiction play mechanisms as employed in physical ""gamebooks"" — non-interactive passages of text (sometimes illustrated) being presented to the player (visually as text or read-out-loud audibly, as in A Dark And Deadly Path), who is then posed with options to choose from... generally selected via hot-key or clicked upon with the mouse or joystick. 

Player input is limited to the simple selection of a small selection of multiple-choice options and must advance (but not necessarily fork) a story or narrative and not just further a simulation. Tightly related but distinct is the interactive movie non-sports theme and also of interest are the the Amateur gamebook conversions and Fighting Fantasy gamebook adaptation groups, as well as the Multiple-choice games group for games that initially appear to be CYOAs but have more going on (randomization, bookkeeping) under the hood.

Adventure Book is one software framework intended to facilitate the home production of CYOA games.

"Games using a version of the BigWorld, originally created out of research at the development studio Micro Forte and quickly spun off to a separate licensing company. Both Microforte and BigWorld were founded by John de Margheriti, Simon Hayes and Steve Wang - all based in Sydney, Australia.
The BigWorld software was mostly geared towards the creations of MMOs and virtual worlds and for a time pioneered the practical and scalable load balancing of players in a dynamic shared game space driven by its proprietary Cell app load balancing design. 
BigWorld found initial success in the blossoming Chinese MMO market and drove several titles in PRC and Taiwan including Netease' Tianxia II and others, titles by Userjoy and later Wargaming.net's 'World of...' trilogy - of Tanks, Planes &amp; Ships. BigWorld licensing and global business was driven by Gavin Longhurst who joined in 2005;
Wargaming.net concluded the buyout of the Sydney based BigWorld Technology in August 2012 and shuttering its license business.
Following the impact of global events in Ukraine and subsequent isolation of RUS/CIS markets, the Sydney studio was sold to Riot Games in October 2022.

In some cases the hero may be able to jump or duck. The crosshair can move all over the screen, and the player can use it to point and shoot at enemies. Cabal pioneered this type of game play.

In other shooters, the player's bullets may move along the screen and are capable of hitting any enemy or object that may stand in their path. In Cabal variants, the path of the bullets has no effect on the enemies; in some cases the player's bullets aren't even visible. The player only damages the targets that the cursor was pointing at while shooting.

To be more precise, Cabal-type shooter must have the following characteristics:

"Jane's Combat Simulations was a brand in use by Electronic Arts from 1996 to 2000 for their line of military simulations. EA licensed the name from Jane's Information Group, the publishing company famous for its military reference works. Not only did the deal allow the use of the Jane's brand name, but also the inclusion of Jane's reference material within the games itself.

The games in the Jane's line were developed by several specialized development teams:



One team was located at Electronic Arts headquarters: led by veterans Brent Iverson (designer/programmer) and Paul Grace (producer), previously responsible for games like Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, LHX: Attack Chopper and U.S. Navy Fighters, they continued the Fighters line with Advanced Tactical Fighters and U.S. Navy Fighters '97.

Another team was led by MicroProse veteran Andy Hollis (Gunship, F-15 Strike Eagle II and III) at Origin Systems. They developed the Longbow series.

Former MicroProse employees continued their old company's tradition in jet simulation at EA Baltimore with F-15 and F/A-18.

Sonalysts, Inc. were the naval warfare specialists, developing 688(I) Hunter/Killer and Fleet Command.

Finally, Israeli developer Pixel Multimedia developed Israeli Air Force and United States Air Force.


The deal with Jane's was not renewed by EA beyond its original five-year length. The Jane's brand however reappeared in 2002, on Mad Doc Software's Attack Squadron, and in 2011 on JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters, published by Evolved Games.

The only games which would become available for purchase after the initial license expired were the two titles by Sonalysts, 688(I) Hunter/Killer and Fleet Command, but in slightly modified versions which omit all references to the Jane's Information Group.",8561,Jane's Combat Simulations

"Pokémon role-playing games developed by Game Freak that appear on a handheld system, where the goals are to collect as many Pokémon as possible, and to collect all of the badges by traveling to Pokémon Gyms and defeating the Gym Leaders in Pokémon battles. Though the games may have other plotlines, the end is always reached once the player has earned all 8 badges and defeated the Pokémon League Champion. Gameplay may continue after the credits roll, allowing the player to further develop their team of Pokémon.

Main Pokémon RPGs are released in complementary pairs (Red/Blue, Gold/Silver, etc); the assortment of Pokémon available to catch will differ between the two, requiring that the player trade with a person owning the other game in order to complete their Pokémon collection. A couple of years after a pair of games is released a third complementary game is often released; this third game is generally the same as the first two but with minor graphical and gameplay enhancements, minor changes to the storyline, and a slightly different selection of Pokémon. For example, in Pokémon Ruby, Team Magma were the enemies and the player caught Groudon at the end; in Pokémon Sapphire, Team Aqua were the enemies and the player caught Kyogre at the end; in Pokémon Emerald, both Teams are the enemy and the player has a chance to catch both Groudon and Kyogre at the end.

The release of a new pair of games in the main RPG series heralds the start of a new generation of Pokémon; most Pokémon make their first video game appearance in one of the core games. About 100 new characters are released every generation.

Arthur Wynne, from Liverpool, England, created, what many consider, the first modern crossword puzzle. It was published in the New York World newspaper on December 21, 1913. It was called ""Word-Cross"". A few weeks later, due to a typesetting error, the name became ""Cross-Word"". [Source: Wikipedia]",8674,Genre: Word / Number puzzle - Crossword puzzle

"Mass Effect is a series of science fiction games developed by BioWare. The games merge role-playing game mechanics with squad-based third-person shooter combat. The first three Mass Effect games are set in the same futuristic universe, and are united by an overarching storyline and a common protagonist, the human Commander Shepard.

Setting and story

Mass Effect games are set in the end of the 22nd century. A discovery of a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by an advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans, allowed the humans to travel beyond the limits of the solar system, establish colonies in space, and encounter alien civilizations within the galaxy. Many of these have been accustomed to space travel longer than the humans, utilizing artifacts known as Mass Relays to travel instantly across vast stretches. The most advanced races established a conglomerate body of governments known as the Citadel Council; other races (including humans) are represented by ambassadors sent there. The overarching story of Mass Effect games involves a new threat to the galaxy: a race of ancient non-organic predators known as Reapers, whose goal is to exterminate all organic life. 

The universe of Mass Effect is populated by many alien species, each with its own culture, history, and peculiarities. The three that occupy permanent seats in the Citadel Council are the unisexual asari, who resemble blue-skinned human females; salarians, distinguished by their fast metabolism and short life cycles; and the fierce, honor-bound turians with raptor-like faces. Other alien species seen in the games include the environmentally suited humanoid quarians; the reptilian krogans, often engaged as mercenaries; the methodical, monotonous-voiced and quadrupedal elcor, and many others. 

Mass Effect Andromeda is set in the Andromeda galaxy and the player takes on the role of Ryder. The game introduced 2 new alien species, the Kett and Angara.

Gameplay

In the first three Mass Effect games, the player takes the role of Commander Shepard, whose gender, appearance, and abilities are customized by the player. There are six character classes in the games, distinguished by their proficiency in firearms, tech abilities (sabotaging enemy defenses) and biotic powers, which are similar to magic in other games. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies and completing quests. When a character levels up, the player can invest accumulated talent points to develop his/her skills (mostly combat-related) and passive abilities.

Combat implements cover-based third-person tactical shooter mechanics, similar to Gears of War. In the first three games, the player directly controls only Commander Shepard, but can position his/her two companions simultaneously, and pause the action to issue more specific commands to them. In Andromeda, a new combat system was featured which takes place in real time.

The player will be presented with choices during the course of the games, many of which would influence subsequent events. The morality system in the games allows the player to tend either towards the values of the law-abiding, honorable Paragon, or the rebellious, self-centered Renegade. Relationships with companions play an important role in the games; the protagonist can also become romantically involved with a companion, provided the player has chosen the right actions.",8742,Mass Effect series

"Games in this group are a specific type of strategy games where the goal is to prevent enemies from crossing the map by placing various armaments on the board at the start of the round, which then attack foes when they are in range of the armament (also known as a tower). Building (or upgrading) towers often has a cost associated with it; money is accrued as enemies are destroyed. In some games the units are placed on a pre-designed board or maze, while in other games the goal is for the player to build the maze themselves using the towers.

"This group includes games that take place during (and are about) the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815). Not to be confused with the French Revolutionary Wars (1792-1802), which were concerned with defending the French First Republic and the revolutionary ideals of 1789. Most titles in this group are strategy games, Napoleon being widely recognized as a military genius himself.

Background: The Napoleonic Wars are a series of military conflicts fought by France and its smaller allies on one side, and several coalitions headed primarily by the British Empire on the other. The coalitions came to include a different number of other countries across the years, with Austria, Prussia and Russia committing the most in blood. Napoleon ended up conquering most of continental Europe through military victories and diplomatic efforts, installing members of his family at the head of various petty states and forcing alliances on defeated enemies. Despite having the humanistic gains made by the French Revolution of 1789 as a main premise, the belligerent countries were not driven only by ideological reasons. The coalitions wanted to reestablish the balance of power and maintain the previous territorial status quo on the European continent, while the France-Britain antagonism was fueled by a centuries-old rivalry. On the other side, Napoleon's ambition was determined mainly by his personal appetite for conquest.

While Napoleon has fought as a soldier or as a general since the War of the First Coalition (1792-1797), most historians place the start of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, when Napoleon, having absolute power in France, had repeatedly breached the peace signed at Amiens in 1802, thus giving start to the War of the Third Coalition (1803-1806). Others consider that this particular series of conflicts started in 1799, when Napoleon seized the power in the country and named himself consul.

The wars marked a turning point in military history, as mass conscription, implemented by both sides, meant that an unprecedented amount of soldiers fought in battles. In terms of technology, the armies were better equipped thanks to mass-produced weaponry, and the role of artillery in military tactics increased. The Napoleonic Wars caused millions in casualties worldwide, and together with the Seven Years' War (1754-1763) is regarded as a prelude to the World Wars of the next century. The greatest battles were fought at Trafalgar (1805), Austerlitz (1805), Jena (1806), Borodino (1812), Leipzig (1813) and Waterloo (1815).

"Games that use blacksmithing as a part of the game play. For purposes of this game group, blacksmithing is defined as:

""The use of one or several metal-based ingredients with or without the use of certain apparatus to create a certain outcome in the form of a metal-based weapon, armor, tool or similar device.""

Acquiring ingredients for blacksmithing purposes within the game may be acquired through mining, defeating monsters or purchase at a local shop. Blacksmithing also often requires the use of certain apparatus other than ingredients or recipes (e.g. forge, anvil, part-time dwarven flame throwers, etc.)

Limitations  





The inventory of blacksmithing used in the game has to be somewhat large. So games that only have two metal ores just to create a dagger (and only those two metal ores in the game) are excluded from the game. Any game that identifies more than 10 ingredients that can be used for blacksmithing should qualify for this game group;




The player must be the active blacksmith in the game and does not require the use of a third party or NPC (Non-Player Character) to do the forging for him/her. Thus, usually the player may seek a forge and directly combine metal-related ingredients directly from his or her inventory or in other cases from the warehouse or other means of storage.




This game group is limited to classical or medieval use of blacksmithing that require certain ingredients or recipes for the formula to work. Games that simply use two (or more) items of non-blacksmithing value (i.e. hot fudge sundae with an elven pencil sharpener) are excluded from this game group.




Items produced from blacksmithing are limited to the medieval or classical sense. Games that allow the forging modern weapons such as an AK-47 or a 'sci-fi with a twist' weapon, such as a laser-beamed broad sword are excluded from this game group (unless, actual medieval-type weapons/armor, etc. are also available).




This is not a blacksmithing-themed based game group. Games must include the process of blacksmithing as part of the gameplay. So puzzle games or adventure games where the player chases an orc blacksmith around (without actually doing any blacksmithing) are out.

Note that having children is an optional choice, thus the player must actively decide whether or not to have children or decide to conduct in an activity that leads to the likelihood that children may be resulted from that action (do we really need to explicitly mention which activity? :p).




Games where children are automatically produced without prompting the player (usually strategy games) should be excluded from this game group.




For purposes of this game group, children happily born in the game should have an active effect on gameplay, either in the form of a controllable child, a child which offers certain bonuses to the character, or having a child will prompt the player to adapt an additional form of gameplay (e.g. raising the child). Games where children merely represent a graphical feature without any effect on the gameplay, consequence of story/ending, or other alternatives that do not affect the overall gameplay should be excluded from this game group.




Godsims or games where the player can force the population to produce offspring, should be excluded from this game group. Unless of course, a child actually is the offspring of the player.




Acquiring monsters or other forms of life and raising them not as children should be excluded from this game group. The parent-child relation should be explicitly noticeable in this regard. So pokémons, digimons, and all other mons are out.

"Included in the group are games in which the protagonist may (or is required to) date/court other player-controlled characters or non-player characters (NPCs) with romantic intentions, choosing the player's attitude towards the character in either actions or dialog choices. 

In order to be part of this group, dating has to be a gameplay element. It does not have to be the main gameplay element (such as in Japanese dating sim games), but there must be at least some gameplay-related choices concerning a romantic relationship.

Limitations



Games that only feature dating as a story-related element are not included, if there are no dating gameplay mechanics present. Thus, Leisure Suit Larry games or many Japanese linear adventure games should be excluded from this game group. Although their stories may focus on dating, the player has no dating-related choices in those games. Visual novels with multiple choice however, do qualify for this game group, provided these choices have a direct impact on the protagonist's dating prospects.

Also not qualified are games in which the protagonist seduces women through purely physical actions (such as many sex games by Illusion).

Notes: 



No original compositions, even if they mimic styles of existing composers are allowed.

No licensed modern day classical music is to be included in this group.

For the purposes of clarity, only games with either a prominent and sustained performance (no 15-second loop emanating from the in-game radio receiver) or numerous instances (Peggle) are allowed.

If the use of the composition(s) is uncredited, be sure to submit a trivia item.

We advise you not to blindly include games, featuring Beethoven/Bach/Mozart/Schubert in the credits, until you're absolutely sure that those instances are significant enough for inclusion.

"Dead Rising is a sandbox survival horror game series made by Capcom. In each installment, the protagonist finds themselves at the centre of a zombie outbreak, and must discover its origins by completing individual chapters (or ""cases"", as referred to in-game) in order to progress through the story within a specific amount of in-game time (usually three days). Alternatively, the player can choose to either spend the three days dealing with ""psychopaths"" (people driven mad by the outbreak); helping free other survivors of the outbreak; killing zombies for the entire time; or, if the player is willing, sit doing nothing in a zombie free area until the timer expires. If the player manages to complete all cases before the timer expires, they will unlock an extended story mode and/or an extra game mode.

The games take place in a large environment, e.g a shopping centre or a Las Vegas strip style area. Players can explore them at their leisure, and can utilize many items found in them as weapons, such as roulette wheels or coat hangers. In the second game, it is also possible to combine various items to form improved weapons. Food found in various areas can also be used to restore health. Players can also change the characters attire with any items of clothing found in the game world.

The various games have also received various DLC add-on packs, expanding the story with extra missions that act as either sequels or prequels to the respective main game.

"The Alarm für Cobra 11 games are based on the German television series of the same name, first aired in March 1996, following the lives of different police detectives. They carry the official license. The first game based off it was Alarm für Cobra 11, released in 2000. The first titles were handled by different developers, including VCC Entertainment GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Davilex Games B.V. and Provox Games.

From Alarm für Cobra 11: Nitro (2006) onwards, all development is handled by Synetic GmbH. Its next game, Alarm für Cobra 11: Crash Time was also the first to be released outside of Germany. Since the international audience was largely unfamiliar with the series, despite it being broadcasted in different countries, it was re-branded as Crash Time outside of Germany, with the follow-ups Crash Time II (2008) through Crash Time 5: Undercover (2012). In Germany, the Alarm für Cobra 11 title was still used.

All initial games were Windows titles, but starting with Alarm für Cobra 11: Crash Time in 2006, Xbox 360 versions were developed alongside as well.

The games feature the same cartoon characters from the show. Dexter is a 10-year-old boy genius with a satirical and rebellious personality. His huge laboratory contains contraptions of all types which he has invented. Many of the storylines are based upon sibling rivalry with his older sister Dee Dee as well as conflicts with Mandark, an equally intelligent schoolmate and Dexter's nemesis.

"Xak is a series of medieval-themed action role-playing games by Micro Cabin. The title refers to the world of humans, which exists alongside Oceanity (the world of faeries) and Zekisis (the world of demons). The three worlds came to exist after the War of Sealing between ancient, but increasingly powerless gods and demons ended in the latter's defeat. The storylines of the games focus on Latok Kart, a warrior who must vanquish demons that found their way into the world of Xak.

Gameplay-wise, Xak games drew much inspiration from Falcom's Ys series, focusing on simple character-building, exploration of complex overhead areas, and action-based ""bumping"" combat. The gameplay system is distinguished by Latok's ability to jump, which is sometimes required to overcome obstacles in the games.",9033,Xak series

"Games where the action takes place during the Interbellum, that is between the First World War and the Second World War (1918-1939, more or less, depending on your country's vision of the world), or, in other words: in (roaring) 1920s and (dirty) 1930s. Fedora hats, Tommy guns, prohibition in USA, the Great Depression, jazz &amp; swing, rapidly growing commercial aviation and radio, the beginnings of television, introduction of sound (&amp; color) in movies, Art Deco, Bauhaus - and those classy curvy cars! But on the other side: the rise of Nazism/Fascism and Communism, which soon led everything to be Gone With The Wind.

Limitations



Exclude games that are set during either World War I or World War II. In certain cases exceptions can be made to extend the period to early 1940s: say, if the protagonist is a private eye on a Hollywood murder case in 1942, then it's all right to include the game here; but if the hero is a Resistance fighter in occupied France, then the game should go to World War II group. Games that are set in fantasy worlds that share certain stylistic elements with this real-world setting (such as for example Discworld Noir) should be excluded as well.

"A medieval strategy/role playing/simulation hybrid series originally developed by TaleWorlds Entertainment. Its major highlights include cavalry combat simulation, direct participation of the player's character in real-time 3D mass battles, factions, armies, recruitable non-player characters (NPCs/companions), quests, manual trade, and town development. The series allows the player to pursue an open path to the player's discretion with little or no identifiable main plot.

The following applies to all games within the series unless expressed otherwise:



Factions  


Mount &amp; Blade and Mount &amp; Blade: Warband feature the same fictional medieval world, while Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire and Sword is set in medieval Eastern Europe. Each faction consists of generals, most of which control town(s) and/or castles(s), both of which control a specific number of villages. All these locations are viewable from the main political map and may be visited by the player to reveal further action menus or optionally enter them in a 3D environment.

The player may attempt to join a faction by first gaining reputation. Gaining reputation may be achieved by winning battles and completing quests. When the player's global reputation reaches a certain level, a faction's warlord may request the player to be hired as a mercenary. If the player accepts, the player will be considered as an independent army within the faction and be subject to wars that faction is facing.

When the player reaches a more significant reputation level, the player may request to the leader of a faction to become a noble of that faction. As a noble, the player has the right to bear a personal banner and be given a starting village to rule. Depending on the course of a war and internal politics, the player may fight or plot to obtain the right to a town or a castle. Joining a faction will, if the player chooses to do so, allows the possibility of marriage (only available in Mount &amp; Blade: Warband) with a warlord's relative of the opposing sex. A courtship must first be conducted before the proposal is accepted. The new spouse may allow further political actions to be accessible.

The player may also opt to start a rebellion from within a faction or join up with individuals (claimants) that have claims to the throne of each faction, both of with involve constant battles with the usurped faction. Mount &amp; Blade: Warband also provides the third and hardest option of becoming an independent king of a new faction.



Cavalry Simulation and Real-Time Mass Battles  


Combat initiates when the player's party encounters an enemy party on the main map (or in other cases, events). The player in third or first person perspective participates in battle alongside all the troops of both parties (depending on the unit limit - i.e. max 150 units). The player may engage on foot in melee combat, ranged combat (bow or crossbow), or if the player is in possession of a horse, enables a unique feature to enter mounted combat allowing the player to charge the enemy for minimal blunt damage or inflict significant  crouching damage against an enemy unit when using specific polearm weapons.

In Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire and Sword, the crossbow is replaced with gunpowder based weapons.



Companions  


The player may, in addition to units, hire the services of NPCs (in taverns) who act as companions to the player. Companions may also be equipped with weapons and armor. Companions cannot be killed in combat and will only become unconscious (wounded) if he/she falls in battle.

Additionally, companions react to the company of other companions, preferring or hating some over the others. The combination of the player's leadership, events, and attitudes of a companion towards another, will affect the overall happiness of a companion. Unhappy companions may opt to leave the player. The like/hate algorithm between companions are pre-determined, where the total enmity between some companions outnumber companions that like each other. Thus, it is not possible to have all of the available companions happy all the time without some form of directed strategy by the player.



Character Development  


Character advancement (player and companion) is skill and experienced based. Statistics that may be developed are:

+ **Attributes**  
Consists of four stats which allows the cap limit of a skill to be increased, in addition to attribute-based bonuses. One attribute point may be distributed per level.
+ **Skills**  
Consists of twenty-four skills, some of which affect only the player/companion, others used as a party skill (only party member with highest skill used), while a few others affect all units. One skill point may be distributed per level.
+ **Proficiencies**  
Consists of six weapon proficiencies which may manually be increased by consistently using a specified weapon-type in battle. Ten proficiency points may also be distributed per level.


In Mount &amp; Blade and Mount &amp; Blade: Warband, a character creation feature is available by selecting the character's background which will later be represented in stats and skills. Character creation has been removed from Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire and Sword and replaced with a pre-generated male character.",9119,Mount & Blade series

"Tōhō (Touhou) is a series of games made mostly by ZUN - one person who works under the Team Shanghai Alice name. He collaborated with Twilight Frontier for several games. The series is set in a fantasy world based on Japanese mythology and faiths, such as Shintō and Buddhism. The action takes place in ""Gensokyo"", a land inhabited by various races like fairies, vampires, tengu, ghosts (most of them are yōkai - supernatural creatures in Japanese folklore). Almost all characters are girls. Reimu Hakurei (Miko) and Marisa Kirisame (magician) are the main heroines since they appear in most games, often as the main playable characters.

Most of the titles are vertically-scrolling shooters in the ""Danmaku/bullet hell"" style and 1 vs 1 fighting games (usually those with the number after the decimal point, like 7.5, 10.5 or 12.3). In addition to the canon games there are also artbooks, and audio CDs with music.

The series has a huge fanbase, and fans have created many fangames based on it in various genres: shmups, shooters, platforms, RPGs, strategy games, etc.

Tōhō is related to the Seihou series. ZUN helped to create it and shared characters from Tōhō.

"The technological advancements of CD-ROM media and real-time decompression allowed games in the late 1980s and early 1990s to use full motion video, primarily for cutscenes. In an attempt to make games more film-like, these cutscenes soon went beyond traditional animation or CGI rendering techniques and used traditional live-action film making, with real actors, props and sets. Widespread throughout the 1990s, this style of cinematics has diminished in popularity by the mid-2000s, with a few notable exceptions like entries in Electronic Arts' Command &amp; Conquer series.

This group collects games with such live-action elements for the static cut-scenes only. Games that use live action for the interactive gameplay use the game genre Art Style: Live action instead.

Limitations:



The live-action footage must have been acquired through traditional film making techniques, using video or film cameras shooting at common frame rates like 24, 25 or 30 frames a second. The footage must also be shown within the game at similar film-like frame rates. Thus, games that feature digitized images of actors that are later animated are not to be included (example: Mortal Kombat);

The games must feature original footage. Sometimes, movie-based games contain scenes from the movie they are licensed from. These games are not to be included unless the footage, while shot during a motion picture shoot, was specifically intended for game usage (example: Enter the Matrix).

""The use of equipment, instrument(s) or similar device(s) by the player, used to extract minerals or geological equivalents from seams, veins, or other conventionally known sources.""

Equipment usually used in mining may range from a pick, dynamite, a painful set of fingernails to modern/sci-fi laser-based mining equipment, or the Gnomish ThrustMaster 3000™.

Successful digs will result in precious metal(s), ore(s), rock, or other geological material, which must be subject for further activity or manipulation; may it be for the purposes of blacksmithing or to be sold for profit (in this case, must be manually conducted).

  

Mining copper ore in Terraria (2011).

Note  

Sci-fi simulation games where the player may manually mine asteroids, comets, or similar locations for minerals from his/her ship should also be included in this game group.

Limitations  



Games where further activity or manipulation of extracted material does not exist or where it is conducted automatically without the need of further intervention from the player should be excluded from this game group.

In relation to the above, strategy games where mining is a minor feature, where its use is identified only as a source of income should be excluded from this game group. This usually refers to strategy games such as Age of Empires, Sid Meier's Civilization, or Starcraft.

Games where mining is only part of the game plot and its activity may not be freely accessed at any time by the player should be excluded from this game group.

"Games with matching armor and/or weapon sets, if worn in a complete set will provide additional bonuses to the playable character(s) wearing them.

The matching armor / weapon set feature was originally introduced by the game Dungeon Hack (e.g. Lost Items of Midnight, consisting of Midnight armor, a Midnight helm, a Midnight shield, and a Midnight sword) and later re-popularized by Diablo with random armor / weapon sets, which depending on the armor / weapon (other games may include weapons and shields in the entire set) provided the player-controllable character with additional bonuses such as statistical bonus, resistances, or special abilities. This information is usually displayed through the character sheet or inventory screen.

Special sets that follow Diablo's style of armor / weapon sets are sometimes identified with a unique name color different from ordinary items (usually white) such as blue, purple, or gold. Additional information may also be provided to help the player the complete armor set [e.g. Spiked Thong (Purple) part 1 out of 2 of the Dwarven Flaming Bikini Armor Set].

Limitations



Games with that coincidentally appear to be armor /weapon sets that do not provide additional bonuses or effect, or is not reasonably seen to be an intentional feature should be excluded from this game group.

This game group is limited to armor sets for the purpose of character protection. Games that offer matching fashionable brand designed dwarven underwear or anything remotely similar to (heaven forbid) Barbie's wardrobe or fashion-only equivalents, is not the primary intention of this game group.


An exception to the rule may be applied to games such as Fable: The Lost Chapters where armor sets do exist, however no additional bonuses are known to be provided if completed, other than additional information that it is indeed part of a collect-able armor set, sub-quest requirements that require a full armor set to succeed, and an exceptional medieval fashion sense.

"Dragon Age is a series of role-playing games by BioWare. The games are set in the fictional medieval fantasy world of Thedas, which has its own background history, races, and ideologies. Dragon Age games are party-based, and utilize BioWare's signature ""real-time-with-pause"" combat system.

Setting

The continent of Thedas is divided into several countries, such as Ferelden, Orlais, Free Marches, and others. It is populated by the sentient races of humans, elves, dwarves, and the humanoid qunari. Elves are presented as reclusive and mistrustful of humans; dwarves live a rigid caste-based society; the qunari follow a strict moral codex that is often incomprehensible to the humans. A major religion of Thedas is the worship of the Maker and his spiritual wife, the prophet Andraste. The church that practices this religion is called the Chantry; organizations associated with it include the Seekers, reminiscent of a secret police, and the militant Templars. Opposed to them are the Blood Mages, renegade sorcerers who draw upon demonic powers to cast their spells. Another important organization are the Grey Wardens, who fight tainted creatures known as the Darkspawn. The storylines of Dragon Age games usually involve conflicts between these and other factions; the player is sometimes able to choose a faction to side with.

Gameplay

The first Dragon Age (2009) signified a return to tactical battles and heavy character customization, similar to BioWare's own Baldur's Gate series. There are three basic character classes in Dragon Age games: warrior, mage, and rogue. Each class has unique specialization areas, e.g. mages that focus more on healing, elemental spells, inflicting status ailments on enemies, etc. They can also evolve into specialized classes, such as for example berserker for the fighter class. Abilities and skills are learned by distributing corresponding points when leveling up. Main character attributes can also be increase in that way. Much attention is paid to the relationship of the main character with his/her companions; the protagonists are able to have romantic relationships with them, depending on the player's conversation choices and other decisions during the course of the game.",9213,Dragon Age series
"Games based on the tile-matching game first implemented in 1981 on the PLATO computer system by Brodie Lockard, commonly known as 'Shanghai' after its first home computer release by Activision in 1986. 

Allegedly based on an ancient Chinese game known as ""The Turtle"" or ""Destroy the Turtle"", gameplay takes the form of removing tiles from a stack with the goal of clearing it. Tiles can only be removed in pairs that are a) identical or from the same set, b) not covered from above and c) can be freely moved to either the left or the right.

Since the original and many following implementations used tiles of the otherwise unrelated Chinese game mahjong, the game is often called 'Solitaire Mahjongg' and many variants have the word 'Mahjongg' in the title.

"Games which features cooking raw or prepared ingredients using any method available (e.g. over an open flame or simply by combining two or more ingredients) for the purposes of creating item(s) which must be identified as a consumable food item. The food then may optionally be used by the player-controlled character or non-player characters (NPCs) for consumption/eating, usually to avoid a starvation feature or other similar features that may introduce a positive or negative effect when mentioned food is consumed (e.g. heal health).

Examples



Using raw beef and turning it into steak in Minecraft.

Cooking raw meat over an open flame in the Gothic series. Some games offer further manipulation which may include seasoning or similar activities.

Creating a loaf of bread from dough in the Ultima series.

Brewing a herbal drink or making soup with a cooking pot.


  

Survival cooking in the game Pilot Down: Behind Enemy Lines (2005).

Note



Creatable drinks and beverages may also be identified as food.

Survival cooking usually may be conducted anywhere during the game, with varying requirements depending on the food item being prepared. Some may require recipes, an open fire, or experimentation through the process of random combining ingredients.

To be clear the method of cooking and whether or cooking has additional requirements to create a food item is irrelevant, as long as the end result is a food item which may be consumed by the player-controlled character.


Limitations



Not to be confused with Genre: Simulation - Cooking, where cooking is a major theme in the game, and usually the purposes of cooking is not to be consumed by the player controlled character. Hence, food items must be identified as a consumable object to be used primarily by the player-controlled character.

"This game group features games where the player controlled character may hunt animals or similar creatures in the wild, primarily for the purpose of harvesting byproducts from them. The hunted animal or creature is usually slain or incapacitated in the process. Hunting in this regard is a minor or an optional feature in the game and does not qualify for the Sports: Hunting sub-genre.

Hunting is usually a common feature in role-playing games and some adventure games, among others the wilderness survival genre. The byproducts of these creatures, may come in the form of food (e.g. meat), recipe ingredients (e.g. bear claws), or trophies (e.g. stag antlers; trophy harvesting is a term usually used to specifically identify big game hunting). These byproducts, depending on the type, may allow further activity or manipulation, such as selling the byproducts to merchants, cooking meat products for food, tanning animal skins to be made into leather products, or to be used in alchemy recipes.

Depending on the game, the process of hunting an animal may be as simple as killing an animal or creature, which will automatically leave behind a body, carcass, or byproduct. A specific skill (e.g. gut animal) in addition to having proper tools or items in the inventory may be required to conduct byproduct extraction from a body or carcass.

Limitations



Hunting an animal or creature that does not result in hunting byproducts should be excluded from this game group. Unless the byproducts are the result of a drop rate algorithm, which identifies a chance that an animal or creature may sometimes not drop byproducts or the extraction of a body or carcass may sometimes result in failure.

Some strategy games, most commonly the 4X genre, often have hunting features, however is not the primary intention of this game group due to the lack of additional activity or manipulation required of byproducts after a successful hunt and should be excluded from this game group, unless the game offers additional activity or manipulation of byproducts.

Gold, monetary units, or randomly dropped items regardless of the animal or creature, are not considered to be hunting byproducts. Dropped items are usually unique to the animal or creature resulting in reasonably identified hunting byproducts.

Hunting byproducts that only exist in its capacity as a part of a quest, plot/story, or puzzle, or any event where its presence is mandatory to further advance in the game, should be excluded from this game group, unless hunting and its byproducts still remain an optional feature to the player.

Not to be confused with Gameplay feature: Fishing, where a hunting activity and byproduct extraction may be similar. Fishing activities and its byproducts should primarily designated to the fishing game group.

Dungeon crawlers: Games that take place in dungeons or other constructs, should be excluded from this game group. Hunting for the most part must take place in the wild or a natural environment.

"The Crackdown games are a series of open world third person shooter games with RPG elements which take place within the fictional Pacific City. The player takes on the role of an ""agent"", genetically and cybernetically enhanced super humans designed for law enforcement created by a company known only as ""the agency"". Agents have improved strength, speed, agility, firearm's proficiency and driving abilities.

During each of the games, the player takes control of an Agent unique to that game in order to deal with multiple threats from various hostile elements and bring them under control. The player's five key abilities (melee, agility, guns, explosives and vehicles) will improve depending on what applicable area they are using at the time. Missions are non-linear and non-time constrained, so the player can play missions in any order, and take their time in between them to deal with random criminals. 

There are also street races in which the player can participate in. The first are car races which improve the players driving abilities and the second type are rooftop races, in which the player races across rooftops as fast as possible to improve the player's agility.
Two types of orbs are scattered throughout each game for the player to collect: Agility Orbs improve the player's agility, whilst Random Orbs slightly improve all of the player's five attributes.",9303,Crackdown series

"Role-playing games (RPGs) inspired by Diablo, Diablo II, or Diablo II: Lord of Destruction (or all), copying similar gameplay mechanics, many of which were first introduced or later popularized by Diablo games to a high degree.

The popularity of Diablo later popularized the re-use of jargons such as Action-RPG or hack-and-slash RPGs, which was often incorrectly used to specifically refer to Diablo-style gameplay. 

Primary Characteristics

To qualify as a Diablo variant, the game must fulfill all of the following primary characteristics, which may be identified as Diablo-style gameplay:

Abundant Item Variation

Traditional RPGs usually offer limited variations of items. Diablo-style games introduced an abundant form of armor, weapons, and other items (usually by the hundreds or more) of varying types and quality. See armor and weapon sets for further related information. Items of higher quality will usually will cost more by an extreme margin compared lower quality items when bought/sold at merchant non-player characters (NPCs).

Armor and Weapon Sets

Armor sets and weapon sets refer to matching armor or weapons, if worn/wielded in a partial or complete set may provide additional bonuses to the playable character(s) wearing them. Special sets are usually identified with a unique title colored distinction different from ordinary items (usually white) such as blue, purple, or gold. 

Quick Slots

Quick slots refer to graphical slots as an alternate for instant assessable items, usually located at the bottom screen of the main display. Slots, depending on the game, may be as numerous as ten or more slots. Some games have introduced less, while others have introduced additional windows for more slots. Quick slots usually have a numerical designation, where the player may press the specified key for instant use. Additional slot features may also include cool-down effects.

Minor Bosses

Minor bosses refer to stronger versions of the random monster, usually identified by unique title colored distinction, similar to armor sets or weapon sets. Minor bosses usually guard chests that appear to be more valuable than ordinary chests and may drop more valuable items when defeated.

Real-Time Hack-and-Slash Combat

Primary gameplay usually refers to real-time combat where the player continuously attacks a targeted enemy (i.e. by constantly clicking a specified mouse button) until the enemy is vanquished. This type of hack-and-slash method usually involves minimal, automated, or no unique and manual form of dodging/parrying techniques other than moving or running away.

Other Characteristics

Diablo-style games may also introduce one or more of the following of characteristics, often seen in Diablo variants:

Armor and Weapon Sockets

Diablo II introduced sockets by embedding gems into individual armor or weapons for the purposes to make them stronger through additional effect (e.g. +5 fire attack). These gems may come in varying qualities and even sets, or which higher qualities or a more complete set will produce a more powerful outcome when attached to a specified armor or weapon. Diablo variants have introduced similar features, replacing gems with similarly equivalent items, such as tokens, animal parts, etc., with the same or similar purpose as the original feature introduced in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction.

Auto-Mapping

An auto-mapping feature, either visible in-game or may be made visible after pressing a specified key. The auto-map is featured as not to disrupt real-time gameplay by using a transparent display, the density of which for some games may be customized by the player.

Item Gambling

A unique type of merchant that sells items with a twist: the true abilities of sold items are unknown, only to be revealed when the item is bought, usually at a very high price. The gambling feature refers to whether or not the price is equivalent to the later revealed attributes. Results may vary from extremely rare items, normal magical items, or even cursed items.

Item Enchanting

Similar to item gambling, an item is deposited to an NPC for enchantment. For a price, the item will be randomly enchanted: ranging from beneficial results such as making it more powerful or adding sockets to negative results such as having the item lose its magical properties or even transforming it to a cursed item.

Isometric Perspective

Many of the first Diablo variants used the same original isometric perspective as one of the primary perspective distinctions. Later adaptations may no longer use the traditional isometric perspective, using varying third-person perspectives instead as the default view. To this point, a first-person perspective Diablo variant has yet to be identified.

Randomly Created Dungeons and Randomly Everything Else

Dungeons, environments, or similar equivalents used are usually randomly created. This may also apply to monsters, minor bosses, dropped items, chests, etc. The starting location of the player however, are sometimes not subject to a randomly created environment.

Hybrid Characteristics

Later developments of Diablo variant games have introduced many new characteristics not unique to Diablo but to a certain extent has remained consistent in some of its variants:

Pet Companions

Diablo II: Lord of Destruction originally used a single human companion. In many Diablo variant games, this later evolved into introducing a single default cat or dog pet companion, though other animals may also be available. These pets accompany the player and cannot be directly controlled. The main purpose of these pets among others is to:



Assist the player in combat, some capable of ranged or magical spells. The pet may also be equipped with items, usually with a limited selection of equipment (e.g. rings only).

Act as additional storage and may be sent back to town to sell items in its possession.

Morph into other (presumably) more powerful creatures, usually when given food (e.g. fish) by the player.  


Fishing

Unlike other games where fishing is (among others) usually reserved as an activity to provide food for the player, in Diablo variant games, fishing primarily intended to obtain fish which when eaten by a a pet companion, will transform it into another (presumably) powerful creature. In other variants, fishing may also result in obtaining randomly acquired items.

Limitations



Diablo games are excluded from this group.

Games that may fulfil a few similar gameplay mechanics introduced or popularized by Diablo games, however in the majority introduces a completely different style of gameplay should be excluded from this game group. Thus, games that may use some similar gameplay features such as Neverwinter Nights are out.

"Tengai Makyō (Japanese: 天外魔境, literally ""Devil World Outside of Heavens"", a Buddhist expression referring to the illusionary perception of the objective world), also known by its English-language tag-lined title Far East of Eden, is a series of Japanese-style role-playing games, most of which are set in a medieval Japan-like world and contain distinct elements of comedy. The series has gained a considerably degree of renown in its homeland, though none of its main installments were ever released in the West. Created by the manga artist Teruhisa ""Prince"" Hiroi, Tengai Makyō was the flagship series of RED Company and also one of Hudson Soft's major franchises. The two companies developed most installments in the series jointly.

Authorship

The series originated on the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD system with Tengai Makyō: Ziria (1989), the first role-playing game (and among the first games generally) to use the CD-ROM format, and also the first game in the genre that had a strong comedy flavor. In the accompanying booklet, a mysterious Paul Hieronymus (P.H.) Chada, apparently a Western historian interested in the Japanese culture, was introduced as the creator of the series. In reality, P.H. stands for ""Prince Hiroi"", while ""Chada"" is an anagram of ""(Hiroshi) Adachi"", alluding to the series' real author. P.H. Chada kept appearing in the manuals of the sequels as well, represented by pictures of Sigmund Freud or Karl Marx.

Setting and Story

With the exception of Tengai Makyō: Daiyon no Mokushiroku: The Apocalypse IV (1997), which takes place in a comical rendition of United States of America, all Tengai Makyō games are set in the fictional land Jipang, which is similar to feudal Japan with supernatural and parody elements (""Jipang"" was an early European designation for Japan). The antagonists in all the games are powerful demon clans, while the protagonists usually belong to the noble Fire Clan, whose duty is to save the land from demonic usurpers. The stories in Tengai Makyō largely follow the formula of the heroes defeating their demonic adversaries one by one, liberating areas controlled by them. The antagonists are often grotesque and comical in appearance and behavior, regardless of their villainous motives.

Recurrent Characters

Though the main cast of heroes is different in every game (with the exception of the eccentric performer Kabuki Danjūrō, who stars in two games), a few supporting and antagonistic characters appear in nearly all Tengai Makyō installments. Among those is the European missionary Hoteimaru who speaks grammatically incorrect Japanese, the avaricious homosexual brothers Ashimoto, and the baboon Manto, notable for his stupidity and continuous failure to foil the plans of the protagonists.

Gameplay

The gameplay in Tengai Makyō games is usually of the traditional Japanese kind, with simple turn-based battle mechanics, linear story advancement, and automatic leveling up. The player usually controls a sole hero in the beginning of the game, with other characters joining the party later. A recurrent gameplay element is the acquisition of magic spells at special locations (usually called ""Tengu Retreats""), which are normally not required to visit in order to advance the plot. These spells can be then freely swapped between the combatants.",9384,Tengai Makyō / Far East of Eden series

Due to the nature of games with castle building, siege combat is usually also a major part of combat.

As many strategy games include various defensive structures, please emphasize on games that really dedicate a significant amount of gameplay on castle building, of which without it would no longer represent the essence of the game adequately.

"This group includes games based on the ongoing manga Meitantei Conan (名探偵コナン; US title Case Closed) by Gōshō Aoyama, serialized in Weekly Shōnen Sunday since 1994. The story follows high school detective Shinichi Kudō (Jimmy Kudo), who, poisoned by members of the mysterious criminal syndicate called Black Organization, transforms into a child version of himself instead of dying. To avoid being killed he assumes a new identity, Conan Edogawa, and decides to live together with his girlfriend Ran Mōri (Rachel Moore) and her father Kogorō Mōri (Richard Moore), who happens to run a detective agency. As Conan, Shinichi continues to solve criminal cases, while hiding his real identity from both friends and enemies. To bring cases to a conclusion and reveal the culprit, Conan can sometimes lead the rather incompetent Kogorō to the truth by throwing hidden hints, or more often he knocks out other characters (usually Kogorō) using the wristwatch tranquilizer and impersonates them with his bowtie voice changer. Because of this, Ran's father has become a famous detective across the series nicknamed the ""Sleeping Kogorō"".

There is a wide cast of recurring characters, including Conan's friends and family, police inspectors from various prefectures in Japan, criminals and so on. The most important ones are professor Hiroshi Agasa (Hershel Agasa), a Kudō family friend and the one who invents Conan's gadgets, The Junior Detective League, Conan's new elementary school friends with whom he solves cases sometimes, Heiji Hattori (Harley Hartwell), a rival high school detective from Osaka, and Kaitō Kid (Phantom Thief Kid), a thief that constantly outsmarts Conan and the police. A lot of the action takes place in Beika City (a pun on Baker Street) in the Tokyo metropolitan area, but the franchise becomes a veritable touristic guide to Japan, as Conan and the gang visit many places in the country.

Besides the manga, the franchise is comprised of an ongoing anime television series, yearly anime feature films, OVAs, live-action movies, audio CDs, and of course video games. New games based on Meitantei Conan are released almost every year, and are usually Japan-exclusives, with The Mirapolis Investigation being the only localized title so far. Generally, they are adventure games with visual novel elements.

"The campaign setting of Greyhawk was first used by Dungeons &amp; Dragons guru Gary Gygax as early as 1972, later sharing his home group's game world Oerth (and subsequent hands-off revisions, permutations, projections and re-launches of said world by later owners of the intellectual property) with generations of RPG players. A home for many standard fantasy tropes and notably the source of many of D&amp;D's fancifully-named author-attributed spells, the campaign setting was eclipsed in the '90s by the Forgotten Realms campaign setting and hence it has been the setting for relatively few computer and video games.

As it was a time of great technological advancements and relative stability (at least in the West), people anticipated something new to come, while others feared the end of a century (fin de siècle).

"Hostilities between Jewish and Arab inhabitants of the Middle Eastern geographical region that has been known, throughout history, as Canaan, Israel, Judaea, Palestine, and simply the Holy Land, date as far back as the year 635 AD, when the land was conquered by Arab Muslims. However, the term ""Arab-Israeli conflict"" refers to the tensions, violence, and wars between Arabs and Jews that followed the proclamation of the Jewish state Israel (established in 1947), and the Arabs' opposition to it.

Included are games that deal broadly with any diplomatic or armed conflicts between Israel and the surrounding Arab states, or specifically with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which refers to the violent confrontations and possible peaceful solutions regarding the disputed territories captured by Israel during the Six-Day War of 1967.

Note: Included games need not be historically and factually accurate, though they must specifically deal with the aforementioned conflict. Due to the variety of political, cultural, ideological, religious, and ethnic tensions involved in the conflict, the use of the video game medium for propagandistic purposes by some of the developers affiliated with a participant in the conflict is inevitable.",9582,Historical conflict: Arab-Israeli conflict

In order to be included in this group, a game must feature space trading as an important gameplay element. The actual percentage of combat and trading in the game may vary; however, in most cases combat is of secondary importance compared to trading and exploration.",9584,Genre: Simulation - Space trading and combat
"This group includes games that simulate space combat. The degree of realism in the simulations plays little role, since, as of now, space combat does not exist (or at least is unknown to humans). However, to distinguish themselves from pure action shooters, these games must emulate a spacecraft's three-dimensional motion in a free environment and have the player control the ship and its weapons, most commonly from a first-person cockpit view.

"The genre commonly referred to as ""shoot 'em up"" (often abbreviated to shmup) has originated with the fixed-screen top-down shooter Space Invaders (1978). This group, however, includes only scrolling (horizontally, vertically, in an isometric or 3D fashion) shooters. In these games, the player controls a character (most commonly an aircraft) that must defend itself against large amounts of enemies by shooting at them. This style of game is generally agreed to have originated with Konami's Scramble (1981) and Namco's Xevious (1982). The player is able to control the character's movement in at least two (more commonly four) directions; however, the forward motion is also determined by the speed of the scrolling. Besides shooting at enemies, the player is also commonly engaged in collecting power-ups, which typically enhance the character's weapons or defense.

Limitations:  

In order to be included in this group, the shooter should answer the two main conditions: scrolling environments and free movement in at least two directions: vertical in side-scrolling games, horizontal in top-down ones. Chase-view shooters and rail shooters should not be included in this group. 

Fixed-screen shoot-'em-ups should not be included in this group either. In general, the distinction between scrolling shooters and fixed-screen shooters is this: in a classic scrolling shooter, barring unusual situations (such as boss battles) the player usually is allowed to avoid or bypass enemies instead of shooting them, and new enemies enter the screen consistently at specific moments regardless of the player's actions. In a fixed-screen shooter the player typically faces wave after wave of enemies, and the next wave will not show up until the previous one has been defeated. A fixed-screen shooter may have a background with a scrolling effect but this alone doesn't make it a scrolling shooter. 

Side-scrolling shooters in which the playable character is restricted in his movements (i.e. is unable to sustain himself in the air for a prolonged period of time, having to jump over obstacles or platforms to proceed, etc.) should be excluded as well.

"The initial form of shoot 'em ups was defined by the genre's progenitor, Space Invaders (1978): the player controls a character (usually a space ship) that can move within the limits of a single top-down screen. Traditionally, the movement is restricted to the sides only; shooters in which the character can be navigated up- and downwards within one screen also belong to this group, since the defining distinction of these games from other shoot 'em ups is the lack of scrolling and the inability to break the confines of one screen until all of the enemies on it have been eliminated and the player moves on to a new stage.

Led by the Manchu clan Aisin Gioro, it was the country's last imperial government before the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 imposed the abdication of the last emperor, followed by the establishment of the Republic of China. It was also the longest-ruling dynasty headed by a non-Han (ethnic Chinese) nation. The rule of the dynasty was marked by gradual weakening and stagnation of China, along with submission to foreign powers.

One of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, Dream of the Red Chamber (simplified Chinese: 红楼梦, Hong Lou Meng) by Cao Xueqin, was written during the reign of Qing Dynasty.

"The Warring States period in China was a continuous struggle for dominance between various Chinese kingdoms, from the middle of the 5th century to the year 221 BC, when the country of Qin emerged victorious, conquered and united China, and became the first imperial dynasty. 

Beside contributing to military warfare, the time period was also the Golden Age of Chinese philosophy, embracing the second (and most productive) period of the Hundred Schools of Thought. Among those, the establishment of Daoism (primarily through Zhuang Zi, although some scholars believe Lao Zi also lived during that time), the development of Confucianism by its followers Meng Zi (Mencius) and Xun Zi, and Mohism (the school of Mozi), were the most notable ones.

"This group comprises all the games set in the Classical period of ancient Greece, which lasted from 499 BC (the Ionian revolt against Persian rule and the beginning of the Persian Wars) until 323 BC (the death of Alexander the Great and the end of his war campaigns). The Classical period follows the Archaic period and is succeeded by the Hellenistic period of ancient Greek history. Culturally, it coincides with the zenith of Greek architecture, sculpture, literature and art in general; politically, it represents one of the most active times in ancient history as various polis-states were fighting each other for domination in the Eastern Mediterranean areal.

While at a first sight, the 5th and 4th centuries BC are centered around the rise of Athens against the Persian invasion and the subsequent hegemony of individual city-states such as Sparta, Corinth and Thebes over the Greek world, imposed through numerous, and sometimes long-lasting conflicts, such as the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC), in fact they are the history of over 1000 Greek states, mostly small, which placed great importance on their independence. They often joined the alliances lead by the greater city-states against each other and were sometimes the very cause of the disputes. Thus, geographically speaking, this setting encompasses a large area: the Illyrian coast, Macedonia, Thrace, central Greece (including Attica, Boeotia, Epirus, Thessaly etc.), the Peloponnesos, the Aegean sea, western Anatolia, Sicily and southern Italy (Magna Graecia).

Games included in this group are frequently real-time strategies that allow the player to control one of the Greek states through a campaign set sometime between 499 BC and 323 BC, but there are other genres explored as well. 

Note: Games based on Alexander the Great's exploits belong here, not in the Hellenistic setting. Any game set in Greece before or after the specified time period should not be submitted to this group. This includes the majority of Greek-themed games, since they are most commonly based on Greek mythology rather than Greek history.

"This group includes all the games that take place in France and the Low Countries between 1337 and 1453. Titles centered around the historical figure of Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc) apply here. Games that give you control of one of the belligerent kingdoms, be it allies of France or England, with the primary goal of participating in the Hundred Years War, also apply to this group. Games that take place in England of the same period do not belong here, unless the player will eventually set foot on French soil.

Background: The Hundred Years War is a series of destructive wars between the House of Plantagenet (England) and House of Valois (France) waged over a variety of reasons, of which the main one is inheriting the French crown and tenures that depend on it. The term ""Hundred Years War"" was invented in the 19th century and is largely symbolical, as the conflict itself lasted for 116 years (1337 - 1453) according to most historians. 

The Hundred Years War initially developed in England's favor, as France was almost entirely occupied by its armies at one point. The battles were separated by frequent periods of truce and dishonest armistices. They were fought primarily in France and the Low Countries, but skirmishes triggered by the French armies on the south coast of England and by their allies, the Scotts in the North also happened. The greatest battles took place at Crécy (1346), Poitiers (1356), Agincourt (1415), Orléans (1428-29).

"Count Dracula is the title character and the main antagonist of Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula (1897). He is an ancient vampire of Transylvanian nobility, who possesses mysterious powers of dark magic. The character was loosely based on the 15th century Prince Vlad III of Wallachia (1431–1477?), also known as Vlad the Impaler, who was rumored to be notorious for his cruelty during his reign against the Ottoman Turks.

The group may include any game in which a character named Dracula displays characteristics reminiscent of the novel's hero (e.g. being a powerful vampire). The game in question should not necessarily be faithful to the novel's plot. Games that are dedicated to the historical character, however, should be excluded.

Cancelled NES game

Late in 1991, publisher Parker Brothers and developer Microsmiths, Inc. had plans to release a NES game titled Drac's Night Out with the tag-line The Game that Pumps You Up!. The game was to carry a Reebok license where when Dracula collected the sneakers he could jump higher and run faster. The game involved players controlling a teenage Dracula who was on a mission to suck the blood of the maiden Mina before sunrise. With gameplay involving trapping villagers in order to suck their blood to regain health, the game unsurprisingly was never released. However, prototypes of the game exist.

"Following several years after The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, Radical Entertainment created another free-roaming, open world super hero type game called Prototype. In the original Prototype, the story, which is set in New York, revolves around Alex Mercer, an amnesiac man infected by the Blacklight virus (created by Gentek scientists), who gains incredible superpowers after being infected. Throughout the game, Alex discovers more of his back story by consuming people. Alex is usually forced to do battle with U.S. Marines and Blackwatch troops on one side and the infected monsters on the other. The second game in the series continues the story of the first game with the plot revolving around what exactly Alex Mercer has been up to after the events of the first game.  The protagonist is now a former US Marine Sergeant names James Heller, who after his wife and child die from a second release of the Blacklight virus (now dubbed the Mercer virus), seeks revenge on Alex Mercer as that's who he holds accountable for his family's death. However, Alex Mercer infects Heller with a variant of the virus, because Mercer wants Heller to join his side in eradicating the Blacklight virus. However, Heller becomes suspicious of Mercer's motives and now equipped with superhuman powers intends to uncover the truth about what's really going on.

Due to poor sales of Prototype 2 (with the game’s global sales estimated by VGChartz at just 390,000 units at the end of June 2012), Radical Entertainment was shut down as a development studio with the remaining employees turning into a team that help support other developers at Activision.",9883,Prototype series

"Dieselpunk is based on the aesthetics of the interbellum period between the end of the World War I and the beginning of World War II. This sub-genre of Steampunk is sometimes named Decopunk, referring to the Art Deco art style (including its Streamline Moderne variant). The genre combines the artistic and genre influences of the period (including pulp magazines, serial films, film noir, art deco, and wartime pin-ups) with postmodern technology and sensibilities. In short: sci-fi looking as if created in 1920s-1930s.

First coined in 2001 as a marketing term by game designer Lewis Pollak to describe his role-playing game Children of the Sun, dieselpunk has grown to describe a distinct style of visual art, music, motion pictures, fiction, and engineering.

"Cinematic platformers are a sub-genre of platform games that attempt to combine traditional challenges of the genre with realistic structure and presentation. These games often feature puzzle-solving elements and setpieces, and play considerably slower than more ""jump and run""-oriented titles. They avoid the abundance of power-ups and score-increasing items and instead emphasize the vulnerability of the protagonist, forcing the player to carefully plot every move (sometimes in a trial-and-error pattern) to overcome obstacles and avoid falling damage. Protagonists in cinematic platformers are normally realistically proportioned, with special attention paid to animation and precise acrobatic moves (climbing, hanging on ledges, rolling, etc.). 

The genre was defined and popularized by Prince of Persia (1989). Other notable examples include French-developed platformers such as Another World (1991). Many of the genre's gameplay elements were carried over as it shifted to 3D. This group, however, only includes two-dimensional cinematic platformers, particularly because the line between various platform genres tended to blur with the advent of 3D.",9899,Genre: Cinematic platformer
"This group includes platform games that allow the player to move between interconnected areas rather than advance stage after stage in a linear fashion. Acquiring specific items and abilities is often needed to access new areas. Role-playing elements such as equipment management are also common, up to the point of featuring full-fledged RPG systems.

The genre was popularized by Metroid (1986) and Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (1987), which later led to the widely accepted portmanteau term Metroidvania, even though there exist earlier examples of this type of gameplay.

Limitations



Interconnected areas and a considerable degree of non-linearity in exploration is the main requirement.

Only 2D platform games are allowed. Overhead games that fulfill the above requirement (such as most Zelda games) should not be part of the group. Games with 3D graphics can only be accepted if they imitate perspective and gameplay of 2D platformers.

Role-playing games are allowed as long as they answer the above requirements.

References to the games

The entire episode 39 of the anime comedy series Sket Dance is about a fictional Chinese clone of Super Mario Bros. (which one is not specified), played on a Fancy Yunpyuter, a parody on Family Computer (Famicom). The game is called ""Super Mariko Broken"" and stars Mariko, who must defeat general manager Kaimei. She also has a sister called Luigiana, seen in the beginning of the game. It begins like a typical SMB game in terms of platforming, with almost identical aesthetics and music, but later on there is even a random monster encounter that must be fought in a first-person view using JRPG-styled commands. Also stuffed in there is a 3D sequence and anime-style cutscenes (this is a cartridge we're talking about). The main characters of Sket Dance take turns playing the game, berating its convoluted controls and design. Ultimately, however, the episode is about loving kusoge (shitty games).",10044,Super Mario series

"ARTS (Arena Real-Time Strategy) or MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena - a term now trademarked by Riot Games) is a sub-genre of the real-time strategy genre with more focus on action. Typically, MOBA games take place on a giant map without unit construction where two players or teams each control a single character. Each character, often dubbed a hero, has a specific skill set and teams are organized around complimentary skills. The objective is to destroy a main structure of the opponents with the help of computer-controlled units dubbed Minions that spawn periodically. These units march towards the opponent through paths that are called lanes. There are also often defensive structures. Heroes earn a currency that can be used to buy items and also gain experience to level up and access new abilities. Heroes can attack each other directly and when they die they respawn at the base after a certain amount of time often combined with a penalty.

The genre was started through Aeon of Strife, a custom map for StarCraft and later further expanded through Defense of the Ancients (known better by its acronym DotA), a custom scenario for WarCraft III. The genre is also often called DotA-based because of the scenario's popularity. The first standalone game based around the concept was Demigod (2009), followed closely by the very successful League of Legends in the same year. DotA itself would receive a sequel as a standalone game under Valve's ownership as Dota 2 in 2013, making WarCraft III no longer a prerequisite for any popular MOBA. Blizzard released their own MOBA Heroes of the Storm in 2015.

Even though strategy is the main focus, the third-person shooter Super Monday Night Combat is also often considered part of the genre.

"Games in which the player can record gameplay actions (by saving to a file) and later view them (non-interactively). Often done in replay editor mode, which enables changing camera views, playback control etc. Other games require to be run with command-line switches to allow recording/playback.

Replays are sometimes called demos, confusingly (as this term has many other meanings).

History of use

While generally superseded today by video capture, before the required advances of video compression and improvements in computers' performance it was the only way to record the player's gameplay (without a camera).

Such recordings can be used to document speedruns, as any user with the same version of the game can play it back. New game version may cause things to play out-of-sync (or fail to play at all, usually the case with older versions). Synchronization errors may also occur in the case of recording multiplayer events.

Saved replays (also gameplay recorded via video capture) are used to create machinima (usually after being edited using other software). Similar technique may be applied (coupled with scripting) to produce game-engine based cutscenes.

Limitations



Games which only offer short non-recordable after-action instant replays (usually sport/racing games) do not qualify.

Games which allow the player to chase a ghost of oneself (usually racing games) do not qualify.

While some recorded replays allow the player to re-enter the action, replay recordings should not be confused with savegames.

Several more games were planned to be released for use with the Aladdin Deck Enhancer but were unfortunately canceled.

* Bee 52 Big Nose the Caveman CJ's Elephant Antics DreamWorld Pogie
* F16 Renegade Go! Dizzy Go! Metal Man
* Mig-29 Soviet Fighter Stunt Kids* Team Sports Basketball
* The Ultimate Stuntman

Trivia

The idea behind the compact cartridges was to take circuitry that was common to all NES cartridges and remove it placing it in the Deck Enhancer, leaving the game cartridge containing only parts that were unique to each game (mainly the game code.) Since the game cartridge now contained fewer parts, the manufacturing cost (and thus the cost to the consumer) was to be lower. To play the game you would plug the compact cartridge into the deck enhancer which would form a complete NES cartridge which could then be used in the normal fashion. Very few games appeared in compact cartridge form (seven total, including Dizzy the Adventurer which came with the Deck Enhancer.

"Games where capturing monsters (usually through combat or other violent means) is a major or minor gameplay element. First popularized by Pokémon and later Digimon games, it has become an expected though not required characteristic in monster breeder/tamer games.

A successfully captured monster may be later viewed in the player's inventory, bestiary, or equivalent interface. These captured monsters are frequently further manipulated for other purposes, such as converting them to become minions or companions. In other games, a captured monster may be sold or destroyed for the purposes of being processed as alchemic ingredients.

Note  

Until further notice, the term 'monster' should be limited to creatures resembling fantasy-type or sci-fi manipulated creatures. Up to this point it is still unclear if 'monsters' is just a place holder name that may one day include any variation of life form, including people, domesticated animals, or even cybernetic entities. Until that line has been established, use popular use of the term 'monster' in gaming.

Limitations  



A 'capture monster' feature must be explicitly expressed during gameplay.

Recruiting a monster or non-player character (NPC) does not constitute a 'capture monster' feature. The purposes of this feature is to identify games where a monster is captured without consent. Any formed of optional consent by the monster in mention should be excluded from this game group.

Example:  

Character A uses a sword in combat. Skill(s) and/or attribute(s) of character A related to that activity will gradually increase depending on how often that action is used (e.g. strength attribute increase from 18 to 19, bladed weapons skill increase from 30 to 35, etc.).

"This group contains all games in which the character development is based on manually developing character attributes or skills. When certain criteria are met, a fixed amount of points is distributed to raise a character's attribute or make them learn or improve a skill. 

Special cases



Also included are games in which skills are bought instead of improved, as long as there is an underlying experience points mechanic. Example: Deus Ex: Human Revolution.

If a game has partly automatic skill distribution, it still belongs into this group. Example: in Baldur's Gate some stats (e.g. hit points) rise automatically, but others like thief skills are divided manually.

The group can also include games which disguise the experience points mechanics. Examples: System Shock 2 has no level ups but is still a valid entry because the cybermodules work like directly distributed experience points. They are only received after completing objectives or exploration.

Deus Ex: Invisible War is not valid because augmentations and upgrades are bought with money. There is no experience point mechanic present.

A rule of thumb: when in doubt and the game in question is not an RPG, there is a good chance it does not belong into this group. However, there are exceptions like No One Lives Forever 2

The games take place in a post-apocalyptic version of Moscow that has been devastated by a nuclear war, rendering the surface radioactive and forcing the survivors to dwell underground, in the city's subway system. Divided into several factions, among those Neo-Nazis and communists, the humans also encounter a mysterious race of creatures known as the Dark Ones. 

Developed by 4A Games, Metro games combine first-person shooting with stealth and survival horror elements. Typically the ammunition is limited and the player is encouraged to stay unnoticed when traversing areas populated by human enemies. Segments that take place on the surface require the protagonist to wear a gas mask and periodically change its filters in order to stay alive. The games are largely linear and contain many scripted events and setpieces.",10311,Metro series

Besides humans, the continent is populated by elves, dwarves, as well as the humanoid races of the tiny Lillbees, the giant Boldans, the Corns who possess a horn on their foreheads, and the vampire-like Darkeniths.

"This game group identifies games where the player-controlled main character or protagonist is an elf, usually by definition identified explicitly within the game or may have reasonable similarities to assert that the character is an elf. 

Traditionally, elves (plural) refer to a fantasy or supernatural being originating from European, specifically Germanic and Nordic mythology and folklore, with later adaptations from (but not limited to) the British Isles. The fantasy and high fantasy genre which for the most part influenced the identity of elves in games, were popularized by J. R. R. Tolkien's books which in turn influenced many other fantasy gaming systems, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, usually as an optional race from a selection of various races.

Elves today however, usually refer to pop culture references derivative of the aforementioned mythology, folklore, and predominately fantasy fiction. These elves may include some of the following characteristics (specifications may vary):
* Physical characteristics may include:
    + Pointed ears, a characteristic usually found in fairy folk or other supernatural/magical creatures similar to humanoids. In Japanese popular culture, the size of the ears may be exceedingly grown or noticeably large.
    + A tall and often lean posture, sometimes taller than 190 cm in height. Sometimes also identified to be less muscular than the average humanoid (an elf bouncer is not a common occupation).
    + A fairly pale or sometimes greenish complexion, depending on the race of the elf in mention.
    + Long hair, supported by the noticeably lack of salons and barbershops in their villages. Curly or bald elves are also usually a rare occurrence.
* Primarily live in forests (sub-race depending), whilst being a secretive and closed society to outsiders. Their primary economy usually involves nature-based products or metal products unique to the elven race.





Longevity or even immortality, a natural consequence of being a supernatural or magical creature. Their average lifespan usually far exceeds the normal life expectancy of humans, usually by hundreds if not thousands of years.




Possess natural acuteness with magic, which usually identifies them as mages or similar classes involved with magic. In addition to magic, they are also identified as having higher than average agility and dexterity (read=fast and accurate) as well as having weapons skills mastery, particularly in archery.

"This game group features games where the player controlled character may farm, garden, or participate in botanical activities involving plants or equivalent flora, primarily for the purpose of harvesting byproducts from them. 

Farming, gardening, or botanical activities in this regard, is a minor or optional feature in the game and does not qualify for the Genre: Farming Simulation game group. Farming, gardening, or a botanical activity is usually a common feature in the wilderness survival genre and role-playing games, although some hybrid adventure games may also have this feature. The byproducts of these plant or equivalent flora, may come in the form of fruit, vegetables, seeds, leaves, flowers, etc., which may later be used as food or ingredients for cooking or alchemy. 

Before harvesting a plant, a botanical process must first be conducted to ensure the plant's survival, at least in the form of watering or fertilizing the plant. Other more complicated activities may include planting seeds or the plant itself, moving a plant from one location to another, maintaining an irrigation system, etc. Failing to maintain the plant may result in the plant's death or a lower harvest of byproducts.

Depending on the game, the process of farming, gardening, or a botany may be as simple as selecting the plant, which will automatically leave behind byproducts or a specific skill (e.g. botany) in addition to having proper tools or items (e.g. gardening tools) in the inventory are required to conduct harvesting from a plant. 

  

Dwarves planting underground grain in Craft the World (2013).

Limitations





Merely selecting a plant or equivalent flora and attaining a byproduct (e.g. picking berries from a bush) does not qualify as farming, gardening, or a botanical activity. This is only known as foraging. Further complex activities must be available to the player-controlled character. If no maintenance is required, the option of moving a plant one from one location to another should suffice.




IMPORTANT: Games where farming is the primary feature of the game should not be included in this game group and should be added to the Genre: Farming Simulation instead.

"This group includes all licensed games based on the Tour de France, an annual bicycle race founded in 1903, currently part of the UCI World Tour. Most titles pertaining to the group either task the players to manage a cycling team, such as the Pro Cycling Manager series, or control an individual cyclist, like Konami's Le Tour de France.

Background: In 2013, Tour de France reached its 100th edition, since there were no events organized during the World Wars. Early editions had fewer stages, but ran for about 400 km each. Gradually, the organizers introduced more stages, but with shorter distances. Nowadays, the Tour de France has 21 stages during a 23-day period (in July, usually). Most of them are placed in France, but detours into neighboring countries are common. For example in 2009 there were two stages in Spain and two in Switzerland, while the 1998 Tour started in Ireland. Road bicycle racing is a high-endurance sport, and as such it is not uncommon for 1/3 of the starting riders to drop out of the Tour.

There are three main types of stages: most of them are mass-start stages where all participants start and race together; every Tour has at least two individual time trial stages, while sporadically a team time trial may be included as well. Furthermore, the difficulty of a stage changes depending on weather conditions and relief.

The racers compete in different classifications. The general classification is determined by the racers' finish times, and the winner is awarded the yellow jersey. Difficult climbs, such as mountains, reward those who reach the top first with a number of points. The cyclist who earns the most points receives the polka dot jersey. A similar classification is awarded to sprinters on flat relief, and the prize is a green jersey. Finally, the riders under the age of 26 compete for the white jersey, based on their finish times.",10515,Le Tour de France licensees

"This game group features games where the player controlled human or humanoid character may attempt cannibalism, specifically human cannibalism as an optional activity. 

Cannibalism for the most part is usually expressed by the game. Either by identifying the food item as human remains, a cannibalism skill or perk, or a message indicating the attempt of cannibalism. Usual practice consists of devouring human flesh which may result in positive and/or negative effects. Positive effects may include nourishment, reputation, etc., while negative effects may include in-game social sanctions, being cursed, etc. Although the purpose of cannibalism is usually for nourishment or food, some games may introduce more sinister purposes, such as a black magic requirement, a cannibal achievement, or to enact revenge on your in-laws.

Humanoids not normally identified as eating humans or their own kind may also be included in this group, e.g. an elf protagonist eating dwarven flesh, etc.

Limitations





This is not a cannibal-themed game group. Cannibalism must be an optional activity made available to the player. Games where cannibalism is the result of the plot/story, quest, or other mandatory requirements are to be excluded from this game group, unless the option to freely cannibalize other humans still remains. Games where the protagonist starts as a cannibal should also be excluded, being a mandatory activity, unless the cannibal protagonist may optionally eat a strictly non-human diet.




Is limited to human cannibalism. Thus, a vegan vegetable protagonist does not count. Neither do vampires, werewolves, or other flesh eating monster protagonists. The protagonist must be identified as a stereotypical human, where cannibalism may be considered an exotic break from the normal diet.




Games where cannibalism is a choice, however by doing so, may include a feature where the character permanently becomes a cannibal, should be included in this game group.




Games where cannibalism may exist unofficially, e.g. via modding, should be excluded from this game group.



Note  

There are some games where the context of cannibalism is unclear e.g. player may eat a wizard, that coincidentally looks human, though no additional information is provided by the game to explicitly identify cannibalism as a unique feature. In any event where a cannibalism feature is uncertain or unclear, it is preferable to not include such games in this game group.

"Games that feature a day and night cycle, including specific time signifiers such as dawn, afternoon, midnight, etc., usually indicated by an in-game clock, graphical background, or any equivalent feature indicating the passing of time. Games that have this feature may also introduce time specific events, such as different monsters, sub-quests, or equivalent events which may only be accessible at a specified period of time.

Games in this game group must also introduce a direct gameplay consequence.

Examples  

[For adventure and role-playing games]  

Character A receives a sub-quest to hunt down vampires. Shops selling wooden stakes are only open during the day. Vampires do not roam during the day. Hence, character A must buy relevant equipment during the day and wait until nightfall to perform the quest.

[For strategy and simulation games]  

Units are harder to detect, travel less frequently, and gain movement penalties at night. However, they are easier to make camouflage checks and can also commence ambush attacks at night more successfully.

Limitations



Games that may feature a day and night cycle, however do not additionally feature unique events related to the differences of time (e.g. only a graphical feature) should be excluded from this game group; the passing of time in itself is not enough to qualify for this game group. This also includes games where time is only presented as a deadline reminder or only a graphical feature of limited vision (which is more of a light/darkness feature than it is a day/night cycle feature).

Games where a day and night feature is only due to a trigger effect from a plot driven quest (e.g. time only advances when finishing a quest) or due to entering a specific location, should be excluded from this game group. A day and night cycle must always be in effect regardless of the player's actions, unless the game in mention is turn-based.

"Games where the player controlled avatar/unit has an identifiable age or time signifier which will gradually increase while playing (or in some instances, decrease). Aging will result in changes to the player controlled avatar/unit such as physical changes (e.g. gray hair), attribute changes (e.g. lower or higher attributes), or other specified age-related changes (e.g. constantly whining). In some cases, aging may result in permanent death due to natural causes.

For games to qualify in this game group, a related consequence must be explicitly expressed by the game, such as positive or negative effects or new abilities/activities/features that may be attained only after reaching a certain age, or at the very least a graphical alteration of the character growing old.

For role-playing games (RPGs) or games of other genres that may have character development features, this is usually identified in the character or unit sheet/information display.

Limitations



Only applies to games where the player has control over an avatar or unit(s). Games where an age is identifiable, however they are controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) without any form of direct player control should be excluded from this game group.


Note: Ordering a character to act without actually controlling it directly is considered eligible for this game group. Units or characters such as monsters or pets, may also be eligible for this game group. Non-player characters (NPCs) or any unit not subject to the player's control as stated above however, should not be included.





Games where the age of a player controlled avatar/unit is identifiable, however no immediate consequence of an age increase/decrease is noticeable (e.g. age increase/decrease not followed by a graphical change or other changes of note), should be excluded from this game group.




Games where aging is only temporary through unnatural means of magic or potions (e.g. wither strike or potion of aging) should be excluded from this game group. This is a common feature in Dungeons &amp; Dragons games or similar role-playing games and should be excluded from this game group.

Single player games storing player's data locally (e.g. allowing to quit playing and to return to game-in-progress another day) open the possibility of player manually backing up critical files - this is called save scumming and is considered cheating. Multiplayer games store players' data on server to prevent this.

Limitations



Games where permanent death is only a level/difficulty option e.g. exists only in hardcore/nightmare mode or where permanent death is optional and not the default mode, should be excluded from this game group. Hence, games such as Diablo should not be included in this game group - instead, they belong in this separate group.

Games that have a continue feature or multiple lives should be excluded from this game group. The permanent death feature must have the effect of the player losing all level progression, prompting the player to restart a new game, where the new game is indistinguishable from the first time the player played the game. Some games however, may have some minor achievements, scores, or other minor features recorded. Games that reward the player with additional lives during the game (e.g. via items) may be included in the game as long as losing all level progression is still in effect.


Note  

Rogue variants may also be included in this game group. Though please note that that some variants out there may not have a permanent death feature or that feature is optional.

"Games based around the ""Taxman"" concept, invented by Diane Resek in the early 1970s. From a limited pool of numbers, the player takes a number and gains the selected amount of points. However, the computer opponent then takes for himself all the numbers which are real factors of the chosen number. If no real factors are present, the number cannot be chosen by the player and is taken by the computer. The game ends when there are no more numbers available, at which point the player wins if he has scored more points than the computer. 

In Germany, the game is known as ""Zahlenhai"" (""Number Shark"").

"Games where player actions during the course of the game may lead to at least two different story endings. Multiple game endings will usually occur at the same part of the game. Different endings are usually represented by noticeable different graphics, text, or cut-scenes. Gamers sometimes translate specific multiple endings with terms such as good ending, bad ending, etc.

Games where only a single ending exists, however may have additional story text or information in regards to the consequences of player actions which may differ if the player chose differently, may also be included in this game group.

Examples of multiple endings:



Different endings based on the player's final choice of a lover/partner/boy or girlfriend in dating simulations.

Different endings based on the character's final alignment, usually referring to good or evil actions.

Different endings based on the player's party composition of different characters, etc.


Limitations





Games that end at different locations throughout the game does not necessarily identify an ending. An ending or a complete ending should be expressly different from a game over, signifying the end of a game without no possible player actions available to continue the story. Games that may have several endings, however it is still possible to continue the game if the player chooses differently resulting in only one complete ending should be excluded from this game group.




Should not be confused with games that may have different endings due to a pre-determined selection by the player at the start of the game, such as character classes, multiple protagonist selection, factions, etc. Multiple endings in this regard should exist solely due to player actions during the game and not by a pre-determined factor, such as character, class, or faction selection, unless said variables have at least two possible endings.



Example: Choosing Rome and winning the game results in a Roman ending cut-scene. Choosing Carthage and winning the game results in a Carthaginian ending cut-scene. These games should be excluded from the game group, unless both Rome and Carthage have at least two different endings based on player actions during the game.



Should not be confused with achievements, monster/enemy kills, or any additional information that does not contribute to the atmosphere of what should reasonably be identified as a story ending.


Note: Some may consider these spoilers.

"Commodore Format Power Packs were cassettes found on the cover of the Commodore 64 magazine Commodore Format which contained various games, demos and utilities every month.

Commodore Format was a UK computer magazine dedicated solely to the Commodore 64 and was launched in October 1990 by Future Publishing. With Commodore User no longer on the shelves at the start of the 90s and Your Commodore declining in sales, this just left Zzap! to dominate the market but Future Publishing felt there was still life in the Commodore 64 and its software to become serious competition to Zzap!. Although mainly a magazine dedicated to the gaming side of the C64 like Zzap!, there was still other articles and features based on hardware and uses other than games for the machine.

In January 1993, Commodore Format was the best selling monthly Commodore 64 magazine and to become more competitive, Zzap! had a complete redesign and a new name, becoming Commodore Force. Commodore Force lasted 16 issues and became no more in March 1994 with the decline of the Commodore 64 scene but Commodore Format still kept going but as sales fell it became more of a specialist hobby magazine and finally with all major publishing companies stopping making C64 games the magazine finally closed with issue 61 in October 1995.

The following people were editors of the magazine:



Steve Jarratt: Issue 1 - 14 (Oct 90 - Nov 91) Colin Campbell: Issue 15 - 17 (Dec 91 - Feb 92) Trenton Webb: Issue 18 - 35(Mar 92 - Aug 93) Andy Hutchinson: Issue 36 - 43 (Sep 93 - Apr 94) Dave Golder: Issue 44 - 50 (May 94 - Nov 94) Tim Norris: Issue 50 - 51 (Nov 94 - Dec 94) Karen Levell: Issue 51 - 58 (Dec 94 - Jul 95) Simon Forrester:* Issue 59 - 61 (Aug 95 - Oct 95)

"Games in which at least part of the setting is the city of Rome (Roma), Italy. The setting can be historical, present, or futuristic (including imaginary versions of the city).

While 753 BC is traditionally considered to be the year when the city was founded, Rome has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe. The city has been successively the capital of the Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic, Roman Empire, the Papal States and modern Italy. It numbers over 2.8 million inhabitants as of 2017 (4.3 million in the metropolitan area) and includes Vatican City inside its boundaries.

Some of the most popular attractions featured in games are:



Vatican City -- the enclaved city-state which is where the Catholic pope resides and rules. It is comprised of several religious buildings, museums, gardens and most notably St. Peter's Basilica and St. Peter's Square. (e.g. Broken Sword: The Angel of Death)

The Colosseum -- built in 72-80 AD under emperors Vespasian and Titus, it is currently the largest amphiteater in the world. It originally housed fights between gladiators, executions, dramas and other events. During the Middle Ages it was used for various purposes such as a cemetery and as a castle, although gradually it was stripped of its stone to build other edifices in Rome. (e.g. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood)

The Pantheon -- built in its current form in 113-125 AD under emperors Trajan and Hadrian, the Pantheon was originally a Roman temple, although it is uncertain to whom or what it is dedicated. The main part of the temple, a circular room called Rotunda can fit a sphere with a 43 m diameter, while the dome ends with a circular opening at the top, through which a beam of light can get through from outside. Starting from the year 609 until the present day, the Pantheon has been used as a Christian church. (e.g. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood)

Altare della Patria -- an eclectic monument dedicated to Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of a unified Italy. It is a symbol of the modern Italian state where national celebrations take place every year. (e.g. along with the Colosseum it dominates the Rome circuit in Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6)


Generally, Rome is fairly popular among game developers thanks to its rich history and architecture comprising several styles, including Classical, Renaissance and Baroque. When its outdoors are depicted, Rome is shown as a culture-rich city with narrow streets and low-rise buildings. Churches, ancient ruins and classical statues are used often as well.

Limitations:



The game must be set in the city itself, not a surrounding area.

Games that simply claim to take place in Rome are permitted, even without a recognizable landmark.

Games that should be in this group are:



If player visits any school during gameplay and can enter school grounds somehow (this is more often case if the player is a student, but can happen if the player is, say, a detective who is solving a case that involves talking to students and visiting schools campus)

One of the locations you visit during gameplay is a school, even if it is no longer active (e.g. Silent Hill)

If the school is imaginary version of the school, but is visitable (e.g. in Legend of Kyrandia 3 you can visit a classroom where the teachers and  students are all fish)

Imaginary academies that look more like schools than universities (e.g. Harry Potter goes to imaginary academy that is more like school than university, which can be most easily deducted by the age of its students)


Games that should NOT be in this group are:



If the school is no longer a school during the game (e.g. in the game there is a hospital that was in the past used as a school)

If the player is a student of an elementary or high-school, but none of the in-game locations actually let you visit the school campus (e.g. if you are a student and game story happens during summer holidays and you never get to go to any location within a school campus)

Quiz games and the like where you are learning from the teacher NPC, but are assuming all this learning is happening in school, but you cannot go to any school location (e.g. if puzzle game lets you solve math problems on the chalk board, chalk board indicates the gameplay is in school, but it is not visible, often case with NDS puzzle and learning games where you only see the problem at hand or a teacher NPC teaching you, but not the school itself)

If the school in question is for adults (e.g. night classes), or is a guild (e.g. mage guild) that teaches you science, magic, etc., then it shouldn't qualify as elementary or high-school

To enjoy the overall game however, codes were required for later levels, which had to be purchased in the form of an instruction manual book.

Like its release format, the target audience was fairly unusual as the games weren't marketed primarily towards core players: they were instead intended for more casual players and serious computer users wanting some games on their machine.

"Games that feature slavery as a gameplay element within the game, which may include the process of capturing humanoids or equivalent lifeforms for the purposes of enslavement (e.g. prisoners of war to be sold as slaves) or at the very least, selling them as merchandise. The game should explicitly identify the term slave or equivalent terms.

Limitations
* This is not a slave/slavery-themed game group. The game must allow the player to optionally participate in slavery-related activities (as an oppressor, accomplice, or compliant). Hence, games where slavery is only a theme, e.g. the player starts as a slave or any activity that is strictly limited to story with no option to otherwise actively participate in slavery-related activities during the game should be excluded from the game group.



Slaves should be limited to a sentient or of equivalent higher intelligence life form in comparison to humans. Although it could be argued that selling domesticated animals or having pets is in itself a form of slavery, this is not primary intention of this game group.

The art of torturing in games may sometimes include a specified facility where the (un)willing participants will be designated (e.g. torture chamber), where within this facility may contains one or more tools and mechanisms for diverse methods of torturing. The purposes of torturing may include the possibility a unit changing alliances, to divulge information from a captured enemy spy, or at the very least for entertainment purposes, you mentally disturbed individual. A failed (or overly exciting) torture experiment may result in death or an extremely cranky prisoner.

"The Cursed Treasure games are Tower Defense games in which the player is on the dark side and defends his gems against incoming, thieving heroes. The heroes have different classes which will effect their stats and beside the basic heroes, all heroes have an active or passive skill which they can use. 

The defense is made by three different races. There are the green Orcs, the blue Undead and the red Demons. The color of the race defines where they can build their towers, e.g. the Orcs can build on grassland but not on ice. Each race has a single start tower. With enough experience (gained by killing heroes) the basic tower can be upgraded two times before becoming a more powerful building, where the player can select between two different improvements. Beside the towers, the player can cast three different spells, which require mana.

After each level the player himself gains experience (for killing enemies, surviving waves and securing gems). For each level up the player gets three skill points which can be freely used to upgrade buildings and spells for the different races. Each spend skill point will also increase a global ability of all towers (fire rate in the Orc skill tree, range in the Undead, damage in the Demon).",10940,Cursed Treasure series

"Incremental games are a very simple type of games where the main mechanic is to accumulate some kind of resource (money, mana etc.), by repeatedly executing some simple action (e.g. clicking on a button), or simply by leaving the game running in the background.

Often, the resource can be spent on upgrades which allow to collect the resource even faster. These games usually have no goal other than accumulating as many riches as possible, and seeing all the various upgrades that get unlocked with time.

This game group does not differentiate between pure idle games where no interaction is needed to progress, clicker games where progress is only achieved through user interaction, or a mix of both. Instead the pacing genre persistent is used to show the game progresses without user intervention. A game like Clicker Heroes that uses a mix of both, uses the pacing genre real-time as well as persistent.

"Games that feature a targeting system that allows the player to aim at a specific part of the target. Some games with targeting systems may be limited to specified weaponry (e.g. only a missiles have a targeting system). There is no limitation on the nature of the target, it may be a biological life form, thus targeting anatomical parts (e.g. head, arms, torso, etc.) or a building, thus targeting structural parts (antennae, turrets, walls, etc.). Activating the targeting system will inform the player which part of the target is currently being aimed upon, this may also include the entire body/vehicle/structure as a whole or individual parts.

The purpose of targeting system is to selectively weaken the enemy target, as an individual part if disabled may have a specific end result:

Biological target(s)



Head (increased damaged or one shot kill).

Legs (decreased movement).

Arms/Hands (decreased enemy accuracy/weapon drops), etc.


Mechanical / vehicular target(s)



Antenna (decreased accuracy or detection).

Hull (increased structural damage). 

Shield Generator (removes shields), etc.


Structural Target(s)



Power generator (cuts off power).

Turrets (disables offensive abilities), etc.


Historically, targeting systems was first introduced by the game Arctic Fox, where the player controlled vehicle could target parts of enemy vehicles and structures in real-time by scrolling through various parts of the target. This feature was reintroduced later in some science fiction flight simulators. The first instances of anatomical targeting was first introduced by the Fallout series.

Limitations



A targeting system must be present and activated before aiming at a specific part of the target. Games where the target may have weaknesses or may be manually fired upon without activating a targeting system, such as games that have head shot abilities should be excluded from the game group.

Limitations:

"Games where a player's character may optionally acquire an addiction to an external substance with addictive properties. If addicted to the specified substance, the player's character must then suffer ill effects, if after a certain period of time does not continue to consume more of that substance. Real life medical terms may include: substance abuse, addiction, or dependency to describe this condition.

The external substance usually comes in the form of a consumable item, accessible via the character's inventory. Using the consumable item may offer additional bonuses, however with a chance to become addicted with continued use. Addiction may have positive or negative effects, though negative effects should be more dominant. Detoxification or the process to purge the addictive substance from the character is sometimes an optional feature.

External substances with addictive properties are not limited to drugs or narcotics (both are subject to changes or different interpretations per region). That said, any substance within the game that may cause addiction should be included in this game group e.g. coffee, tea, nicotine, etc.

Limitations
* Although it could be argued otherwise, for the purposes of this game group: vampirism is not substance abuse. Hunger and thirst are not substance abuses. An ex-girlfriend or boyfriend are not substance abuses. Please refer to traditional conceptions of substance abuse, addiction, and dependency.

"This group includes all the games that have the player fight in the Great Roman Civil War (49-45 BC), also called Caesar's Civil War. It was fought by Julius Caesar on one side, and Gnaeus Pompeius, supported by the conservative faction in the Roman Senate, on the other side. Caesar emerged victorious from the war, which effectively put an end to the Roman Republic. Most titles in this group are strategy games. The games that only feature battles from the Gallic Wars (58-50 BC) should not be included in this group.

Background: In the first century BC, the cracks in the Roman republican system began to widen. The military reforms performed by Marius, which allowed recruitment of landless people, made the legions faithful to individual generals, in the detriment of the Republic. In the Senate itself, the wealthy factions began to accumulate an unprecedented level of power, marginalizing the poorer senators. Such a corrupt assembly faced dwindling support from the public, that's why there was little discontent when Caesar decided to cross the Rubicon.

The first signs of the Civil War appeared when the unofficial alliance between Caesar, Crassus and Pompeius, called the First Triumvirate, dissolved with Crassus' death in 52 BC. Pompeius became increasingly closer to the conservative faction in the Senate, and went as far as to accuse Caesar of treason in 50 BC. Caesar, a hero in the eyes of the people after his victories in the Gallic Wars, fearing prosecution by the Senate marched towards Rome without disbanding his legions, which in itself was an act of war.

The war was going in Caesar's favor from the very beginning, as Pompeius, who had a part of his forces stationed in Hispania, had to retreat first out of Italia to Epirus, and then, defeated, to Africa, where he was murdered. The war continued however until Caesar defeated an army lead by Pompeius' sons and his former lieutenant Titus Labienus at the Battle of Munda in 45 BC. Other important battles took place at Dyrrachium (48 BC), Pharsalus (48 BC), and Thapsus (46 BC).",11062,Historical conflict: Great Roman Civil War

"This group includes games that feature protagonists who spend a significant portion of their lives treasure hunting, to the point that it can be considered a full-time occupation. Treasure hunters seek valuable historical or prehistorical artifacts without undertaking any kind of scientific research at the place of discovery, as practiced in modern archaeology. Some such characters can have an archaeological background, like Indiana Jones, since that is certified by an academic degree, but no modern self-respecting archaeologist would actually stoop to treasure hunting. Many early archaeologists, such as Heinrich Schliemann, are considered ordinary treasure hunters. Modern treasure hunters may employ costly state-of-the-art equipment, and use science to search for artifacts, but they have little interest in researching their historical meaning in the context of the site, culture or entire civilization.

Limitations



Games where seeking treasure is a secondary occupation for the protagonist, for example as a part of a quest or wilderness exploration in medieval fantasy RPGs, should not be included in this group.

Pirate protagonists should be included in their own separate group and are not part of this one, since their primary occupation is piracy.

"Games in which at least part of the setting is France as a country. The setting can be historical, present, or futuristic (including imaginary versions of the country).

Limitations



Actual gameplay part must be available inside the country itself, not a surrounding area.

If the country is only seen through cinematic or as an area on the map, the game should not be included in this game group.

For past and present timeline, the country name must exist as such (for example games set in Roman Empire would not qualify in the country of Italy because the country didn't exist as such at the time).

For futuristic setting, the country can expand or shrink or be in other areas than current (i.e. if the country would start a war and take entire world, then any location there could constitute as a location within that country).

Country's colonies DO NOT qualify as country (whether on Earth or in sci-fi cases, on other planets).

Country must be known under the designated name in the group title, if the country changes its name upon expansion or otherwise, it does no longer fit this criteria.


Note that cities are not constant subcategories to a country. For example, games set in Rome may or may not be part of the Country: Italy group, depending on the time and setting.

"This group contains games from the Ar tonelico and Surge Concerto series, which were developed by Gust Co., Ltd. under the direction of Akira Tsuchiya. Though the two series both exist in the same fictional universe, they seldom overlap in setting and characters. However, they share many themes, including humanity's relationship with various fictional races, planetary annihilation and rebirth, the interplay of magic and technology, and the use of song magic. This magical music exists as both a central plot element and a fixture of the games' extensive soundtracks.

The Ar tonelico series began with Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia in 2006. These games take place on floating continents above the fictional planet of Ar Ciel, where humans exist alongside Reyvateils, an artificially created race of female humanoids that can cast magic by singing. The two races have had a long history of inequality, and the plotlines of these games focus both on human-Reyvateil relationships and restoration of Ar Ciel, whose surface has been uninhabitable for centuries.

Surge Concerto's first game was released in 2012. This series focuses on Ra Ciela, a technologically advanced planet whose main races are humans, Genom, and Sharl. In addition to the similar themes of communication and planetary disaster, the Surge Concerto games also focus on a fictionalized version of quantum mechanics and interdimensional travel, which has resulted in a girl named Ion being transported to Ra Ciela from Earth against her will.",11324,Ar tonelico / Surge Concerto universe

"This group includes games that feature a theme song written for the game explicitly. A theme song is basically the vocal version of the main theme that is probably used in the menu, opening title screen or throughout the game, and by the endgame it plays the vocal version to amplify the theme at the right moment. Sometimes, it only exists as a song, and is not complemented by instrumental variations throughout the game.

Limitations:



The song can be in any language but it must have lyrics (vocals without actual lyrics should not count).

Games based on a movie featuring a theme song written for the movie should not be added to this group.

Games based on anime featuring a theme song from anime or other TV series should not be added to this group.

The theme song must be a song with actual lyrics, not just an instrumental theme.

Remakes or sequels using the same theme song from the first/original game in the series should not be added unless they have their own unique theme song.

Theme songs that are remixes or covers of existing tracks should not be included here (i.e. ""Saboteur"" game featuring remixed version of ""Feeling Good"" by Nina Simone).

If a game features one or more songs during gameplay, but they are not made as the game's theme songs, just random in-game songs, it should not be in this group.

"This game group should contain any Japanese release which is censored in comparison to US or EU release. It doesn't matter if the game is Japanese in origin or not.

The censoring usually happens for two things in particular: gore and adult content.

For gore censorship, it can be as simple as the color of the blood being depicted in another color, to dismemberment scenes being either turned off, the camera avoids them in a smart way if they happen through cinematics, or black screen appears during certain key scene that are considered gruesome enough to be displayed.

For adult censorship, this usually means that naked characters either have clothes (or at least underwear), the camera during cut-scenes avoids showing nude parts, or certain adult elements (from kissing, to sex scenes) are completely removed or partially tuned down in comparison to non-censored version.

Note that censorship does not include ports, only original releases. For example, it is common that adult visual novels for PC are adult by default, but when ported to consoles and handhelds, the adult scenes get removed, but additional content such as extended story or bonus characters are added to the port. This is not censored game, just a port that is different than the original game. Censored game must exist for the same platform in both censored and non-censored release, not if the game exists in such two releases for the same country in which it is made in two variations, but only when release in other countries is not censored in comparison to Japanese release of the same game for the same platform.

Example:

"An alternate reality game, or ARG, is a type of game in which the real world is used to supplement the gameplay in some form. This can take the form of such things as players receiving real phone calls from ""NPCs"", narrative-furthering events being held in real world locations, or requiring players to use outside technology to solve puzzles. ARGs present their plots as events that are really taking place, in order to further the players' immersion in the story, and many circles consider it an unwritten rule that participants should play along with this presentation.

Alternate reality games are often used as a form of viral marketing, though this is not always the case.

* The tank must be playable! If it only appears in a game but you can't drive it or command it directly, the game should not be included in this game group.
* Tank must be controlled directly, meaning there should be commands to drive it and to fire its cannon (if it appears in some real-time strategy where you can issue commands to it as a unit, but cannot steer or fire directly, the game should not be included).
* Only real variants! No fictional types or lookalikes (especially as it's ubiquitous as a ""generic modern tank"" stand-in).

"Boku no Natsuyasumi is a series of Japanese life simulation games developed by Millennium Kitchen about spending a summer vacation as a young boy in Japan. Games in the series have been exclusively released for PlayStation, starting with the original Boku no Natsuyasumi in 2000 for the PlayStation up to the last entry Boku no Natsuyasumi 4 for the PSP in 2009. Games have also been released for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. All games are in Japanese and none of them has been localized for the West. The main creator is Kaz Ayabe. The setting for the first game was inspired by the town of Tsukiyono, in the Yamanashi Prefecture of the Chūbu region. The other games are set in different locations such as a coastal town or the countryside in Hokkaidō.

The games offer a sandbox environment where the young Boku (aged nine or ten) can freely choose how to spend his summer. The games have a limited number of days (only one month in August) and time advances with each new screen. Typical activities include exploring, doing quests, talking to characters, spending time with the family, fishing, bug collecting, swimming, riding a bike, duelling with kids, writing in a journal and so on. The games are meant to be played in multiple playthroughs as there is not enough time to do everything. Boku has the same age in every game, so games two to four are alternate universe sequels. The first three games are set in August 1975, the fourth game in 1985. The freedom and the focus on mundane activities shares DNA with franchises such as Harvest Moon, Shenmue and elements of the Yakuza series.

The game uses fixed screen, pre-rendered environments with 3D models and a cinematic camera with a different viewpoint for each scene. Many scenes offer interaction for the sake of exploration, with no further purpose.

There are four main games in the series, but the developer also created some titles with a similar concept such as Bokura no Kazoku (2005) focusing on raising a family in Tokyo for 35 years and Attack of the Friday Monsters! (2013) for Level-5's Guild series.

Two more games were announced, but eventually never released: a winter vacation spin-off and a smartphone game that was in development at Sony's ForwardWorks Corporation.

The 2022 game Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation - The Endless Seven-Day Journey with a similar concept, but carrying the license of the comic-strip and animation character Shin-chan as he spends his summer in Kyushu with his family, is considered a spiritual sequel to the series with the involvement of the original creators.

The first developer of the franchise was CAPCOM, followed by former CAPCOM developers who left to form Byking, and currently by former Byking developers who were recruited to Bandai's internal VSTG Project team. Core features of the system are its 2v2 competitive team format, and the cost system, where more powerful units are more valuable targets to be shot down.

While obviously not part of the Gundam series, the first game of this style by the original development team was the arcade title Spawn: In the Demon's Hand. Many concepts of the series, including 2v2 co-op, would be refined by the developers when they moved on to the original Mobile Suit Gundam: Federation vs Zeon.",12722,Gundam VS. series

"The Audio Interface Library (AIL) is a sound middleware system originally created in 1991 by John Miles for DOS systems, supporting the myriad of different sound cards on the market through a single unified API, for both synthesized music and digitized samples. Later versions added support for Windows. 

The system was sold to RAD Game Tools in the mid-1990s, who renamed it to Miles Sound System. The system has continued to receive regular updates since then, moving along with the transition from synthesized to purely digital audio. Over the years, support for more operating systems and computer architectures as well as major video game consoles was added and the system remains widely used throughout the industry.

"Gashapon machines are a type of vending machine that distributes collectible toys or figures. Each play of the machine gives the user one random toy out of a set, thus requiring customers to spend a lot of money to complete their collection. Games with this feature use a similar system for the acquisition of playable characters or ""character cards"", in which some amount of in-game items or currency can be exchanged for one opportunity to summon or generate a random character. Some characters may only be available during limited event periods.

These games almost universally use a freemium model; while players may be given a certain amount of free chances at the gacha and/or be able to earn the required currency through gameplay, there is typically also an option to spend real-world money. For this reason, several countries have legal restrictions on games with gacha features, as they can be considered a form of gambling.

"Game Room was a frontend for emulated versions of retro video games from the Atari 2600, Intellivision, and Arcade platforms. Published by Microsoft Game Studios and developed by Krome Studios, it was available for XBOX 360, Windows, and Windows Phone platforms.

The Game Room itself appears as an arcade with individuals rooms that could be decorated with different background themes and items. The games the player purchased appeared as arcade cabinets and could be placed in each room. A room could hold up to eight different arcade cabinets.

Games were released a couple at a time and were downloaded as game packs. Players could play demos of the games on the game pack but each game had to be purchased individually to fully unlock it.

The games themselves offered gold, silver and bronze medals when certain objectives were met. These medals in turn earned the player experience where they could gain a level and gain access to new themes and items for their game room.

The service started on March 24, 2010 and game releases ended with the release of the thirteenth game pack on December 22, 2010. In 2015, Game Room itself and its associated games were delisted for purchase from Microsoft's online store.",13530,Gaming Service: Game Room

The objective of the game is to shoot ""rays"" into a grid to discover the location of objects. Depending on how the rays impact the objects, the rays can pass straight through, be deflected, or be reflected. The only information revealed, however, is the location the ray exited the grid. The goal of the board game is to correctly mark all objects in the grid using as few rays as possible.",13539,Genre: Board game - Black Box

"This game group should contain games that have at least 2 playable character where one is hunter and the other is being hunted by the first character. The relationship can be hunter - prey, police - criminal, or any other such case where one character hunts the other.

Hunting doesn't refer to just literally chasing someone, if one player is a detective trying to find out the culprit and another criminal who tries to evade detection and mask his crime, this too would mean the one is hunting the other even though detective may not be aware of who he is hunting at first.

All these requirement are necessary for game to be in this group:
* Game needs to have at least 2 playable characters.
* Playable characters must be in a direct hunter - hunted relationship.
* Both playable characters must be playable in a same course of the game (could be simultaneously (2-players) or one at the time (singleplayer)). -- What ""in the same course of the game"" means is that if the game has two campaign scenarios where player can play either as cop or a villain where player can either be chased by or chase the AI controlled player, such game does not qualify to be in this group.

Games that should not be in this group:
* When player can control either hunter or hunted while the other character is AI controlled, otherwise all animal hunting games or police/criminal games would fall under this category.
* Any sort of racing game (unless the police cars are included where they can hunt down racers) does not qualify as hunter - hunted relationship because goal isn't to hunt other opponents but to win the race.",13612,Protagonist: Hunter & Hunted

"While many games involve a breeding mechanic for animals or monsters, games in this group have it as one of the core pillars of gameplay, existing for its own sake rather than to facilitate the player's other goals. In a breeding simulation, the objective is to selectively breed for physical features such as colors, markings, and body shape; inheritance of non-aesthetic traits, if it exists, is typically a secondary concern.

Games in this genre can be divided into two subcategories:
* In the first, creature art is static and there is a finite number of variants to obtain; a common player goal is to get a full collection. However, the rarest outcomes come from several generations of specific hybridization, and the player is challenged to figure out the correct ""recipe"".
* In the second variety, offspring are dynamically generated based on the parents' genetics. Though each available breed will share a common base sprite or model, individuals are distinguished by the unique set of colors, markings, and mutations they have inherited.",13725,Genre: Simulation - Breeding

"Battle Royale is a subset of the action genre. The entire game or one of its game modes is based around the concept of last-man-standing. Typically a large number of players start with minimal equipment in a large environment. The goal is to take out all other players to become the last one remaining, most often operating individually and not as a team. There is permadeath and killed players need to wait until the next round to rejoin.

Other elements often vary per game, but defining features are an area that shrinks over time, gradually pushing players closer together. Characters also often start out with minimal equipment and need to search for weapons and armour. There are often elements of stealth and sometimes building features or drivable vehicles. Killed players leave behind loot. There is often progression in skills over games, but typically items are not carried over between rounds.

Limitations: this genre should not be confused with games just supporting Last Man Standing as a game mode. Typical elements as described in the previous paragraph are required for a title to be considered Battle Royale.

Such translations are usually released as patches that must be applied to the original version.

Details about the translations can be found in the games' trivia entries.

Limitations:



The fan translation must be the first translation of the game into English. Sometimes games get re-translated or existing translations get modified to remove mistakes or make them closer to the original. Such later edits or re-translations do not qualify the game for this group.

The translation must be complete. Many translation projects are started and then never finished, or only critical parts like menus and options (but not dialogue) are translated. Only games that have all non-English elements translated qualify for this group.

These games typically consist of a having only a town to get supplies as the only overworld with the majority of the game solely consisting of plunging the depths of a dungeon or climbing all the way to the top of a tower to complete the game. These games typically put an emphasis on looting treasures and getting into combat.

"Relics, which is Bothtec's best known work in Japan, started as a game based on the idea of Yoshihiko Takei, an employee of Bothtec who was later responsible for marketing games developed by Bothtec and Quest. An action-adventure game with a possession mechanic where the players are surrounded by mystery as they try to find out what had happened, why they are navigating through underwater ruins and what they need to do. The game received a release on the Famicom Disk System with the possession mechanic simplified and the gameplay altered due to hardware limitations.
Over a decade later, Bothtec remade the original game as an Action-RPG inspired by games like Diablo and followed it with a sequel titled Relics: The 2nd Birth. A third Action-RPG game was under development, as well as an Xbox exclusive sequel going back to the side scrolling roots of the original game titled Relics: The Absolute Spirit. The Xbox game was going to be the first game of the series to receive a worldwide release.
Due to Bothtec's bankruptcy, the Xbox sequel was cancelled in 2004 and development of the third RPG game was handed over to Nihon Falcom. Due to the lack of rights to use the Relics name, the final game, while keeping all the terms used in the Relics series, as well as the connection to the series universe, had to be renamed as RINNE.",13856,Relics series

"Games that use forms of copy protection where if the game detects that it is a pirated copy, some aspect of the game is changed. This is done to discourage piracy in such a way that is not initially detectable by the pirater. In some cases the game may still be completable by the player, but in others completing the game will be impossible. This can be done in multiple ways:



Include messages asking the player to buy the full version, without otherwise hindering game (usually done by developers who aren't particularly bothered if there game is pirated). An example of this is the PC version of Alan Wake, which replaces the loading screen tips with messages telling the player to buy the game, and also gives the player character an eyepatch.

Disabling certain abilities that the player would usually have access to. Examples of this include: Batman: Arkham Asylum, which disables Batman's glide ability; and Pokémon Black &amp; White and their sequels, which disable experience gain.

Significantly increasing the game's difficulty.

Make it impossible for the player to reach the game's normal intended conclusion. An example of this is Earthbound, which will cause enemies to appear more often, and if the player manages to get all the way to the game's final boss the game will freeze and wipe the player's save data.


Limitations



This game group is specifically for games that contain this type of copy protection built into the version of the game that is officially sold. Games where the developer themselves uploaded modified pirate copies to popular game piracy websites (such as Game Dev Tycoon &amp; No Time to Explain) should not be included.

"In its most basic form, a loot box is a container that can be opened to receive a randomized selection of items. Boxes may be earned during normal gameplay or purchased from an in-game shop, but typically players are required to spend real-world money to open the box and get the items inside. Though many games limit the contents of these boxes to cosmetic effects such as outfits and emotes, others include items that have an impact on gameplay.

Loot boxes became more common in the mid-2010s as a way to add new content and generate revenue for freemium games, but they have also faced criticism for perceived ethical and legal issues. Common criticisms include the possibility that the boxes encourage gambling, as well as concerns about games becoming pay-to-win or developers locking major content behind paywalls. Several countries have thus banned the sale of loot boxes or introduced strict regulations for them.

"Wangan Midnight: Maximum Tune series is a series of Arcade racing games that has been running since 2004 with several releases. Based on the manga by Michiharu Kusunoki it consists of street races set in Japan that are either played in a Story mode against rivals, in a Time Attack mode or in a VS mode where often up to four linked cabinets can race each other locally. The game uses a card system where game data can be saved to maintain progress, driver information or ghosts. Not only the courses are based on real roads, all cars are also licensed from manufacturers such as Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Porsche or Toyota. Games are often updated several times adding new features. There are also often several versions of the game. The most prominent one is always the Japanese version, but next to it there is almost often a general Asian version and a US release. Content may differ between territories. The development is always spearheaded by Namco Limited (now BANDAI NAMCO Amusement Inc.) responsible for the general production, design and the cabinet itself, but always with a support developer responsible for most of the programming and art. The initial support developer was Polygon Magic, later xeen Inc. and now Genki Co., Ltd.

Genki was already responsible for several earlier Wangan Midnight games for Arcade and consoles without ties to Namco or the Maximum Tune series. Genki's involved is not a surprise based on their pioneer work in the genre with the Tokyo Xtreme Racer \ Shutokō Battle series, which most likely heavily influenced the design of Maximum Tune.

Almost every background music track for every title in the series is composed by Yuzo Koshiro from Ancient Corp.",14411,Wangan Midnight: Maximum Tune series

"This group brings together games based on the 1986 title Phantomas by Enrique Cervera for Dinamic Software. Next to the sequel Vampire it spawned a whole series of fangames and unofficial games around the robot thief protagonist. Jose Luis Castano Gonzalez is involved with almost all of these games. It started with the game Phantomas Infinity in 1991. He created the concept with his brother as they both were very eager for a follow-up that never came. It was the title that got him into programming.

There is also an adult spin-off Phantomasa series created by the same Jose Luis Castano Gonzalez. Those games have the female android Phantomasa as the protagonist and have her infiltrate the mansion of Phantomas, the character of the Phantomas games.

Some games might allow players to transform between the two (or more) forms at will, whilst others might dictate when the player is able to transform.

Limitations:



The player character must physically transform and the transformation should ideally be acknowledged by the game. Character-swapping does not count.

This game group does not include games where transformations are limited only to power-ups.

Games where the player transforms at the start of the story but does not transform back do not belong in this game group. Transformation has to be an integral part of gameplay.

Mechanical transformations do not count. The player character must physically change into something that they were not originally.

"Defense games are a specific type of real-time strategy game with a focus on defensive strategies where a single character or a group needs to survive levels or as long as possible against large waves of enemies. It is different from other types of games where defensive strategies are important, for instance Tower Defense or various Strategy games in general, because it uses some specific elements. The game usually takes place in a fixed, single-screen environment*, without scrolling or free-roaming movement.





The player character(s) is/are usually shown from a side view on one side of the screen, sometimes with a barricade or other defensive structures in front, while enemies advance in waves from the other side. Enemies therefore only walk in a single, direct line.




Usually the character cannot be moved and direct control is usually limited to shooting. When the enemies reach the character they usually start doing damage or kill without being able to run away.




The core gameplay is centered around selecting and executing effective defensive strategies based on the properties of enemies. Typical elements include the ability to switch between weapons, building, upgrading or maintaining defensive structures, and/or managing resources or managing currencies to unlock, upgrade and build more advanced defences, weapons or minions. Often the player can also interfere directly by launching specific attacks or through the shooting.




The gameplay is almost always real-time and never turn-based or with a pause option. The games usually do not require complex strategies and have straightforward gameplay.

"Taiwanese mahjong is a unique mahjong variant with several rules which set it apart from other variants. Games are played with hands of sixteen tiles, instead of thirteen as in most other versions of mahjong, with a winning hand consisting of seventeen tiles total. The different number of tiles means that the sets which make up a winning hand are different as well: five sets and a pair. Certain scoring patterns become easier than in other mahjong variants while others become more difficult, and a few special hands which are only possible with a 13-tile hand have been omitted.

Taiwanese mahjong is primarily played in Taiwan and is less-commonly played elsewhere. As a result, most video game adaptations are in Chinese and tailored towards a Taiwanese audience.",15825,Genre: Card / Tile game - Taiwanese mahjong

"Riichi mahjong, or Japanese mahjong, is the most popular mahjong variant in Japan. It adopts the basic rule set of traditional Chinese mahjong but adds several new rules which set it apart. Dora are a set of bonus tiles which add han value to a winning hand, affecting players' strategy. Dora are selected at random at the start of every round by drawing tiles from the wall. The other distinctive rule, which gives the game its name, is riichi. Players can declare their hand once they're one tile away from a winning hand by calling riichi; this locks the player's hand, but also allows the player to win off of certain discards that wouldn't otherwise be possible.

Riichi is traditionally a game for four players, but there are various two-player variants. See also Genre: Mahjong variant - two-player Riichi mahjong.",15831,Genre: Card / Tile game - Riichi mahjong
